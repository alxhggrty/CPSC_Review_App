The recall involves approximately 1,213,000 units distributed in the United States and 968,000 units distributed in Canada. CPSC urges parents and caregivers to immediately stop using the recalled cribs, wait for the free repair kit, and do not attempt to fix the cribs without the kit. They should find an alternative, safe sleeping environment for their baby. Consumers should contact Stork Craft to receive a free repair kit that converts the drop-side on these cribs to a fixed side. The cribs’ drop-side plastic hardware can break, deform, or parts can become missing. In addition, the drop-side can be installed upside-down, which can result in broken or disengaged plastic parts. All of these problems can cause the drop-side to detach in one or more corners. When the drop-side detaches, it creates space between the drop-side and the crib mattress. The bodies of infants and toddlers can become entrapped in the space which can lead to suffocation. Complete detachment of drop-sides can lead to falls from the crib. CPSC, Health Canada, and Stork Craft are aware of 110 incidents of drop-side detachment; 67 incidents occurred in the United States and 43 in Canada. The incidents include 15 entrapments; 12 in the U.S. and three in Canada. Four of the entrapments resulted in suffocation: a 7-month-old in Gouverneur, N.Y.; a 7-month-old in New Iberia, La.; a 6-month-old in Summersville, W.Va.; and a 9-month-old in Bronx, N.Y. Included in these incidents are 20 falls from cribs; 12 in the U.S. and eight in Canada. Fall injuries ranged from concussion to bumps and bruises. The cribs involved in these incidents had plastic drop-side hardware that had broken, missing, or deformed claws, connectors, tracks, or flexible tab stops; loose or missing metal spring clips; stripped screws; and-or drop-sides installed upside-down.

This recall does not involve any cribs with metal rod drop-side hardware. It involves only those cribs with plastic trigger and one-hand-system drop-side hardware. This recall includes Stork Craft cribs with manufacturing and distribution dates between January 1993 and October 2009. This recall also includes Stork Craft cribs with the Fisher-Price logo that have manufacturing dates between October 1997 and December 2004. The Stork Craft cribs with the Fisher-Price logo were first sold in the U.S. in July 1998 and in Canada in September 1998. The cribs were sold in various styles and finishes.

The firm’s insignia \"storkcraft baby\" or \"storkling\" is inscribed on the drop-side teething rail of some cribs. In Stork Craft cribs that contain the \"Fisher-Price\" logo, this logo can be found on the crib’s teething rail, in the manufacturer’s instructions, on the assembly instruction sheetattached to the mattress support board, and on the end panels of the Twinkle-Twinkle and Crystal crib models.

This recall includes fixed-side and drop-side cribs. These cribs pose a risk of serious injury or death due to entrapment, strangulation, suffocation and fall hazards to infants and toddlers. The crib\'s tubular metal mattress-support frame can bend or detach and cause part of the mattress to collapse, creating a space into which an infant or toddler can roll and become wedged, entrapped or fall out of the crib. CPSC has received a report of a one-year-old child from North Attleboro, Mass. who suffocated when he became entrapped between the crib mattress and the crib frame in April 2008. CPSC is aware of 13 additional incidents involving the recalled cribs collapsing due to the metal mattress- support frame bending or detaching, including one child entrapment that did not result in injury, and one child who suffered minor cuts to his head when his mattress collapsed and he fell out of the crib. CPSC staff urges parents and caregivers to stop using these cribs immediately and find an alternative, safe sleeping environment for their baby. Do not attempt to fix these cribs.

This recall includes fixed-side and drop-side cribs. These cribs pose a risk of serious injury or death due to entrapment, strangulation, suffocation and fall hazards to infants and toddlers. The crib\'s tubular metal mattress-support frame can bend or detach and cause part of the mattress to collapse, creating a space into which an infant or toddler can roll and become wedged, entrapped or fall out of the crib. CPSC has received a report of a one-year-old child from North Attleboro, Mass. who suffocated when he became entrapped between the crib mattress and the crib frame in April 2008. CPSC is aware of 13 additional incidents involving the recalled cribs collapsing due to the metal mattress- support frame bending or detaching, including one child entrapment that did not result in injury, and one child who suffered minor cuts to his head when his mattress collapsed and he fell out of the crib. CPSC staff urges parents and caregivers to stop using these cribs immediately and find an alternative, safe sleeping environment for their baby. Do not attempt to fix these cribs. Due to the fact that Simplicity and its successor, SFCA Inc., are no longer in business, CPSC has limited information about the number of cribs sold. All Simplicity drop-side cribs have previously been recalled for a hazard involving the drop side. Simplicity drop-side cribs could still be in use by parents or caregivers who are unaware of the recalls or by those who received a repair kit to immobilize the drop side from Simplicity when the firm was still in business. This recall involves ALL Simplicity cribs with tubular metal mattress-support frames regardless of model number. Crib NameModel Number All Simplicity Cribs with tubularmetal mattress-support frames,regardless of model number ALL Model Numbers The name \"Simplicity Inc.\" or \"Simplicity for Children\" appears on a label on the crib\'s mattress-support frame and-or the crib\'s end panels. The cribs were manufactured in China. The recalled cribs were sold at Walmart, Target, Babies R Us and other stores nationwide for between $150 and $300. Consumers should contact the store where the crib was purchased to receive a refund, replacement crib or store credit. Important Message from CPSC: CPSC would like to remind parents not to use any crib with missing, broken or loose parts. Make sure to tighten hardware from time to time to keep the crib sturdy. When using a drop-side crib, parents should check to make sure the drop side or any other moving part operates smoothly. Always check all sides and corners of the crib for disengagement. Any disengagement can create a gap, which could fatally entrap a child. In addition, do not try to repair any side of the crib with tape, wire, rope or by other means. Infants and toddlers have died in cribs with makeshift repairs.

Clips that attach the tent to the top of the playard can break or be removed by a child. A child can lift the tent and become entrapped at the neck between the rigid playard frame and the metal base rod of the tent, posing a strangulation hazard. CPSC is aware of a death of a 2-year-old boy in December 2008 in Vinalhaven, Maine. The boy was found hanging with his neck entrapped between the playard frame and the metal base rod of the tent that had been partially tied by pieces of nylon rope and partially attached by clips. The tent was tied to the playard because the child was able to pop off the clips. Apparently, the child became entrapped while attempting to climb out of the playard. In three other incidents, children were able to remove one or more clips and place their necks between the tent and the playard. The children were not injured.

If the safety latch breaks, a small spring could be released. Young children could choke on the small spring or gain access to a cabinet or drawer where dangerous items are stored. CPSC and Safety 1st are aware of 27 incidents with these latches breaking. There have been two injuries reported. A 13-month-old girl placed the broken spring from one of these latches in her mouth and suffered a minor abrasion inside her mouth. Also, a 2-year-old girl was able to open a cabinet protected by a safety latch, gained access to a bathroom cabinet and sprayed tile cleaner into her mouth. She received chemical burns to her throat. The latches are made of white plastic with a spring which holds the latch closed. \"SAFETY 1 st\" is written on the top of the latches. Their packaging reads, in part, \"SAFETY 1ST\" and \"CABINET & DRAWER SPRING LATCHES.\" They were sold in a package of three or four latches. The straight ends of the metal springs are uncovered on the recalled latches. The replacement latches have a plastic tab over the short, straight end of the metal spring.

The caddy’s latches do not automatically close to secure the stages and risers when stored. Unsecured stages and risers can fall off the caddies and onto consumers. A 3-year-old girl died in May 2011 in Greenville, S.C., from severe head trauma when a portion of a portable stage fell out of the caddy and onto her at a church. This recall involves Midwest Folding Products’ caddies used to store collapsible stages and risers when they are not being used. The caddies are brown, gray or black metal and measure 44 inches long by 30 inches wide by 60 inches high. They hold six 96-inch long or eight 48 to 72-inch long stage or riser platforms. Yellow caution and instruction labels are located on the caddy’s frame. The recalled caddies were sold by Midwest Folding Products’ dealers to churches, schools, performing arts centers and various other organizations nationwide and online at www.midwestfolding.com from January 1989 through March 2012 for about $1,200. Midwest Folding Products is directly contacting known purchasers of the caddies. Caddy owners and consumers should immediately stop using the recalled stage and riser caddies. Caddy owners should contact Midwest Folding Products to receive a free repair kit with new brackets that will allow latches to automatically return to the closed position on the caddies and new white warning and instruction labels.

Century Offers Cash Reward for Recalled Infant SwingsFour strangulation deaths reported WASHINGTON, D.C. - In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) Century Products Co., of Macedonia, Ohio, offered a $30 cash reward for the repair of each Lil\' Napper infant swing. These swings were recalled in 1997 following reports of three deaths and one near strangulation from entanglement in the swings\' shoulder harness straps. CPSC and Century have since become aware of a fourth death to an 8-month old infant girl in Texas. The swings, which were manufactured by Century from 1991 through 1997, have shoulder harness straps that are placed over each shoulder and buckled between the infant\'s legs. If the straps on these swings loosen or are unbuckled, an infant can become tangled in the straps and strangle. Despite a nationwide effort over the past 2 years to alert the public about this recall, Century believes that many of the 125,000 swings originally sold could still be in use. Century took steps to get the word out, including direct mail notification to thrift stores and notices in new infant and convertible car seats. The recalled Lil\' Napper infant swings can be identified by the following model numbers, located on the bottom of the swing\'s seat: 12-344, 12-345, 12-347, 12-475 or 12-476. The Century brand name is on the motor assembly at the top of the swing. Each swing has a plastic, two-position seat with a removable plastic tray. The sets are covered by either a vinyl or fabric seat pad. There are four white tubular metal legs supporting the swing. The repair program is no longer available. Parents and caregivers should immediately stop using these infant swings and discard or destroy the product. For more information, consumers can call the company\'s customer service number at 800-345-4109.

The product\'s design allows consumers to light the grill at an air intake tube, instead of at the burner. Though the grill appears to function normally, gas inside the air intake tube ignites. The tube can reach temperatures of up to 750 degrees Fahrenheit and present a burn hazard to consumers. In some earlier grills, the heat produced by lighting the grill at the air intake tube damaged the plastic support piece, and caused the grill to fall to the ground. When it collapses, flames from the grill can burn nearby consumers and ignite surrounding combustibles. There have been 44 reports of consumers suffering burns to legs, hands and fingers, including reports of some third degree burns, after the grills collapsed during use. More than 1,000 consumers returned their grills to the manufacturers because the grills collapsed. These red metal gas grills have a tripod stand. They have a logo on the label of the lid and grill base showing a devil cooking at a grill with the writing, \"Red Devil.\" The lid also reads \"The Portable Outdoor Kitchen.\" The black plastic base, above the tripod, reads \"QUANTUM HOMEWARES.\" Components sold with the grill include a heat plate, an oversized skillet with handles, a table-safe serving trivet, and carrying totes. They were manufactured in Hong Kong.Quantum and e4L sold these grills directly to consumers through television infomercials from about May 1998 through January 1999 for about $160. Department and specialty stores, television retailers and web sites sold additional grills. CPSC sued e4L Inc. and Quantum North America Inc. to obtain a recall, and an administrative law judge granted CPSC a default judgment when these manufacturers failed to appear. The firms are liquidating their assets under bankruptcy law.Both the Home Shopping Network (HSN) and QVC voluntarily notified their customers directly about the hazard these grills pose, and provided a remedy. Grills purchased from retailers other than the HSN and QVC are dangerous, and CPSC urges consumers to stop using them immediately. Since Quantum and e4l have declared bankruptcy, there is no remedy available. Consumers who own one of these grills, who are aware of any incidents with these grills, or who want additional information should contact CPSC at (800) 638-2772 anytime. Vendors who are still selling these grills also are encouraged to stop doing so and contact CPSC. About 19,300 of these grills, sold directly by e4L, were recalled in July 1998 because the burners could disconnect from the burner pan. The firm received 21 reports of the burners on these grills disconnecting and one consumer suffered burns. Even if consumers participated in this previous recall program, they should stop using these grills since this warning addresses a different hazard', 'CPSC Issues Warning About Hazardous Red Devil Gas Grills', '2014-10-20', 'Quantum Homewares Red Devil Portable Outdoor Kitchen Gas Grill', 'https:--www.cpsc.gov-Recalls-2002-CPSC-Issues-Warning-About-Hazardous-Red-Devil-Gas-Grills-'),

About 155,000 of these grills were manufactured by e4L Inc., of Encino, Calif., and Quantum North America Inc., of Encino, Calif. Because the manufacturer is out of business, CPSC issued a warning about these grills in May 2002. The product\'s design allows consumers to light the grill at an air intake tube, instead of at the burner. Though the grill appears to function normally, gas inside the air intake tube ignites. The tube can reach temperatures of up to 750 degrees Fahrenheit and present a burn hazard to consumers. In some earlier grills, the heat produced by lighting the grill at the air intake tube damaged the plastic support piece and caused the grill to fall to the ground. When it collapses, flames from the grill can burn nearby consumers and ignite surrounding combustibles. There have been 44 reports of consumers suffering burns to legs, hands and fingers, including reports of some third degree burns, after the grills collapsed during use. More than 1,000 consumers returned their grills to the manufacturer because the grills collapsed. There have been no reports of incidents or injuries involving these grills sold by Wal-Mart. These red metal gas grills have a tripod stand. They have a logo on the label of the lid and grill base showing a devil cooking at a grill with the writing, \"Red Devil.\" The lid also reads \"The Portable Outdoor Kitchen.\" The black plastic base, above the tripod, reads \"QUANTUM HOMEWARES.\" Components sold with the grill include a heat plate, an oversized skillet with handles, a table-safe serving trivet, and carrying totes. They were manufactured in Hong Kong. Quantum and e4L sold these grills directly to consumers through television infomercials from about May 1998 through January 1999 for about $160. This recall only includes grills sold at Wal-Mart. CPSC sued e4L Inc. and Quantum North America Inc. to obtain a recall, and an administrative law judge granted CPSC a default judgment when these manufacturers failed to appear. The firms are liquidating their assets under bankruptcy law. Both the Home Shopping Network (HSN) and QVC previously notified their customers directly about the hazard these grills pose, and provided a remedy. Since Quantum and e4L have declared bankruptcy, there is no remedy available for grill bought from retailers other than HSN, QVC and Wal-Mart. CPSC urges consumers to stop using these grills immediately. Consumers who purchased Red Devil gas grills from Wal-Mart can return them to the store for a refund. For more information, consumers can call Wal-Mart Customer Service at (800) WALMART anytime, or visit Wal-Mart\'s web site at www.walmart.com. Consumers who purchased their Red Devil Gas Grills from a retailer other than Wal-Mart should contact the retailer. If that retailer does not provide a refund, repair or replacement for the grill, consumers should contact CPSC at (800) 638-2772 anytime. Additionally, consumers who are aware of any incidents with these grills or who want additional information also should contact CPSC. About 19,300 of these grills, sold directly by e4L, were recalled in July 1998 because the burners could disconnect from the burner pan.

The product\'s design allows consumers to light the grill at an air intake tube, instead of at the burner. Though the grill appears to function normally, gas inside the air intake tube ignites. The tube can reach temperatures of up to 750 degrees Fahrenheit and present a burn hazard to consumers. In grills manufactured before August 1998, the heat produced by lighting the grill at the air intake tube damaged the plastic support piece, and caused the grill to fall to the ground. When it collapses, flames from the grill can burn nearby consumers and ignite surrounding combustibles. There have been 44 reports of consumers suffering burns to legs, hands and fingers, including reports of some third degree burns, after the grills collapsed during use. More than 1,000 consumers returned their grills to the manufacturers because the grills collapsed. There has been one incident reported by Value City and Schottenstein Stores customers. These red metal gas grills have a tripod stand. They have a logo on the label of the lid and grill base showing a devil cooking at a grill with the writing, \"Red Devil.\" The lid also reads \"The Portable Outdoor Kitchen.\" Components sold with the grill include a heat plate, an oversized skillet with handles, a table-safe serving trivet, and carrying totes.

About 155,000 of these grills were manufactured by e4L Inc., of Encino, Calif., and, Quantum North America Inc., of Encino, Calif. Because the manufacturer is out of business, CPSC issued a warning about these grills in May 2002. Additional Red Devil gas grills were manufactured by Cadac, of Roodepoort, South Africa, but also are included in the recall. CPSC sued e4L Inc. and Quantum North America Inc. to obtain a recall, and an administrative law judge granted CPSC a default judgment when these manufacturers failed to appear. The firms are liquidating their assets under bankruptcy law.

Since Quantum and e4L have declared bankruptcy, there is no remedy available for grills bought from retailers other than HSN, QVC, Wal-Mart, Value City and Schottenstein stores.

CPSC, Invensys Building Systems Announce Recall of Siebe Actuators in Building Fire-Smoke Dampers WASHINGTON, D.C. - In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), Invensys Building Systems, of Love Park, Ill., is recalling up to 560,000 Siebe actuators for testing and replacement, if necessary, which could be found in fire and smoke dampers. Actuators hold open fire and smoke dampers in a building\'s heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system. A spring mechanism, integrated with the damper, is designed to close the damper during a fire to limit the spread of smoke, fire and fumes. The recalled actuators can jam, and prevent the dampers from closing. If dampers fail to close during a fire, serious injury or death can be suffered by building occupants because smoke, fire and fumes can spread through a building\'s ventilation system Building owners, damper manufacturers, and fire and safety investigators have reported dampers not closing during testing. The actuators have been identified as IBS or Siebe MA 200 and MA-200-1series with one of the following model numbers: models MA-220, MA-220-0-1, MA-220-0-2, MA-221, MA-221-0-1, MA-221-0-2, MA-223, MA-223-0-1, MA-223-0-2, MA-230, MA 230-0-1, MA-233, MA-233-0-1, MA-240, MA-240-0-1, MA-240-701, MA-240-701-1, MA-243, MA-243-0-1, MA-243-701, MAH-241-0-1, MAH-241-701, and MAH-241-701-1.

CPSC, Invensys Building Systems Announce Recall of Siebe Actuators in Building Fire-Smoke Dampers WASHINGTON, D.C. - In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), Invensys Building Systems, of Love Park, Ill., is recalling up to 560,000 Siebe actuators for testing and replacement, if necessary, which could be found in fire and smoke dampers. Actuators hold open fire and smoke dampers in a building\'s heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system. A spring mechanism, integrated with the damper, is designed to close the damper during a fire to limit the spread of smoke, fire and fumes. The recalled actuators can jam, and prevent the dampers from closing. If dampers fail to close during a fire, serious injury or death can be suffered by building occupants because smoke, fire and fumes can spread through a building\'s ventilation system Building owners, damper manufacturers, and fire and safety investigators have reported dampers not closing during testing. The actuators have been identified as IBS or Siebe MA 200 and MA-200-1series with one of the following model numbers: models MA-220, MA-220-0-1, MA-220-0-2, MA-221, MA-221-0-1, MA-221-0-2, MA-223, MA-223-0-1, MA-223-0-2, MA-230, MA 230-0-1, MA-233, MA-233-0-1, MA-240, MA-240-0-1, MA-240-701, MA-240-701-1, MA-243, MA-243-0-1, MA-243-701, MAH-241-0-1, MAH-241-701, and MAH-241-701-1.

Announce Recall of Red Devil Gas Grills PRODUCT: Gas Grills - BJ\'s Wholesale Club, Inc., of Natick, Mass., is recalling about 2,800 Red Devil gas grills sold at BJ\'s Wholesale Club stores. These red metal gas grills have a tripod stand. They have a logo on the label of the lid and grill base showing a devil cooking at a grill with the writing, \"Red Devil.\" The lid also reads \"The Portable Outdoor Kitchen.\" Components sold with the grill include a heat plate, an oversized skillet with handles, a table-safe serving trivet, and carrying totes. BJ\'s Wholesale Club Stores sold these grills from about May 2000 through June 2002 for $70. PROBLEM: The product\'s design allows consumers to light the grill at an air intake tube, instead of at the burner. Though the grill appears to function normally, gas inside the air intake tube ignites. The tube can reach temperatures of up to 750 degrees Fahrenheit and present a burn hazard to consumers. In grills manufactured before August 1998, the heat produced by lighting the grill at the air intake tube damaged the plastic support piece, and caused the grill to fall to the ground. When it collapses, flames from the grill can burn nearby consumers and ignite surrounding combustibles. INCIDENTS-INJURIES: More than 1,000 consumers returned their grills to the manufacturers because the grills collapsed. Other retailers have reported 44 incidents of consumers suffering burns to legs, hands and fingers, including reports of some third degree burns, after the grills collapsed during use. There have been no incidents reported by BJ\'s Wholesale Club customers. WHAT TO DO: CPSC urges consumers to stop using these grills immediately. Consumers who purchased Red Devil gas grills from BJ\'s Wholesale Club Stores can return them to the local BJ\'s Wholesale Club for a refund. For more information, call BJ\'s Wholesale Customer Service at (800) BJS- CLUB (257-2582) anytime, or visit the firm\'s web site at www.bjs.com. The Home Shopping Network (HSN), QVC, Value City, Schottenstein and Wal- Mart previously notified their customers about the hazard these grills pose, and provided a remedy. Consumers who purchased their Red Devil Gas Grills from another retailer, should contact the retailer. If that retailer does not provide a refund, repair or replacement for the grill, consumers should contact CPSC at (800) 638-2772 anytime. About 155,000 of these grills were manufactured by e4L Inc., of Encino, Calif., and Quantum North America Inc., of Encino, Calif. Because these manufacturers are out of business, CPSC issued a warning about these grills in May 2002. Additional Red Devil gas grills were manufactured by Cadac, of Roodepoort, South Africa, and also are included in the recall. CPSC sued e4L Inc. and Quantum North America Inc. to obtain a recall, and an administrative law judge granted CPSC a default judgment when these manufacturers failed to appear. The firms are liquidating their assets under bankruptcy law. Since Quantum and e4L have declared bankruptcy, there is no remedy available for grills bought from retailers other than BJ\'s Wholesale Club, HSN, QVC, Wal-Mart, Value City and Schottenstein stores. About 19,300 of these grills, sold directly by e4L, were recalled in July 1998 because the burners could disconnect from the burner pan. The firm received 21 reports of the burners on these grills disconnecting and one consumer suffered burns. Even if consumers participated in this previous recall program, they should stop using these grills since this warning addresses a different hazard.', 'BJ\'s Wholesale Club Recall of Red Devil Gas Grills', '2014-05-23', 'Red Devil Portable Outdoor Kitchen gas grills', 'https:--www.cpsc.gov-Recalls-2003-CPSC-BJs-Wholesale-Club-Inc-Announce-Recall-of-Red-Devil-Gas-Grills'),

The plastic wheel assemblies on these wheelbarrows, manufactured by O. Ames, a predecessor company of Ames True Temper, can break when the tires are being inflated. This can result in plastic pieces exploding from the rims of the wheels, possibly hitting nearby consumers and causing lacerations and other injuries. Ames True Temper has learned of additional serious incidents involving the recalled wheelbarrows since the original recall announcement. A total of 21 incidents have occurred from 1996 to the present, including injuries involving hand, arm and facial fractures and cuts. In a few cases, more serious and permanent injuries have been reported. To prevent further injuries, consumers should not inflate the tires on these wheelbarrows. Ames True Temper is offering a free replacement steel wheel assembly for each wheelbarrow and is offering consumers a free gardening tool gift as an incentive to have this repair performed. The wheel assemblies on these wheelbarrows have a black plastic rim and have an approximately 14-inch diameter wheel. They have red, green or orange tubs or trays made of steel or plastic and were sold under the brand names \"Easy Roller,\" \"Homeowner,\" \"Mustang,\" or \"Thoroughbred.\" The brand name was printed on the label attached to the tray at the time of purchase. Wheelbarrows with metal wheel assemblies are not part of this recall. No \"True Temper\" or \"Jackson\" wheelbarrow is part of this recall.

WASHINGTON, D.C. - In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), four toy jewelry importers today announced the voluntary recall of 150 million pieces of toy jewelry sold in vending machines across America. CPSC has determined that some of this toy jewelry contains dangerous levels of lead, posing a risk of lead poisoning to children. Only about half of the 150 million pieces of toy jewelry actually contains lead, but, because it is difficult to distinguish the lead jewelry from the non-lead jewelry, the industry decided to recall all of it. The four firms are A & A Global Industries, Inc., of Cockeysville, Md.; Brand Imports, LLC, of Scottsdale, Ariz.; Cardinal Distributing Co. Inc., of Baltimore, Md.; and L. M. Becker & Co., Inc., of Kimberly, Wis. CPSC has received one report of lead poisoning when a child swallowed a piece of toy jewelry containing lead that was previously recalled. No reports of injury or illness have been received for the recalled products announced today. Young children sometimes mouth or swallow items like these, and lead can leach from the jewelry into the child\'s body. Lead poisoning in children is associated with behavioral problems, learning disabilities, hearing problems and growth retardation. The four firms have advised the Commission that they have stopped importing toy jewelry with lead and are committed to working with the CPSC staff on eliminating hazardous levels of lead in future importations of toy jewelry. \"With millions of pieces of jewelry involved in this recall, I urge parents to search their children\'s toys for this jewelry,\" said CPSC Chairman Hal Stratton. \"Throw away this recalled toy jewelry.\" CPSC has issued guidance urging firms to eliminate lead in consumer products, or, if lead is used, to assure it is not accessible. CPSC collected and analyzed some samples of toy metal jewelry sold in vending machines and found that 10 of those products had lead that could be accessible to children. The industry volunteered, out of an abundance of caution, to recall additional products. This toy jewelry recall involves various styles of rings, necklaces and bracelets. The rings are gold- or silver-colored with different designs and paint finishes with various shaped center stones. The necklaces have black cord or rope or gold- or silver-colored chains. The necklaces have pendants, crosses or various geometrical designs or shapes, and can include gemstones. The various styles of bracelets include charm bracelets, bracelets with medallion links, and bracelets with faux stones. All the jewelry was manufactured in India. The toy jewelry was sold in vending machines located in malls, discount, department and grocery stores nationwide from January 2002 through June 2004 for between $0.25 and $0.75. The industry estimates that this toy jewelry is kept in homes for a short period of time, but parents should look for these items in their homes. Consumers should throw away recalled jewelry. Consumers can contact these importers for more information about this recall by calling (602) 636-3908 between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. ET Monday through Friday.', 'CPSC Announces Recall of Metal Toy Jewelry Sold in Vending Machines', '2014-06-03', 'Metal Toy Jewelry Sold in Vending Machines', 'https:--www.cpsc.gov-Recalls-2004-CPSC-Announces-Recall-of-Metal-Toy-Jewelry-Sold-in-Vending-Machines-Firms-agree-to-stop-importation-until-hazard-is-eliminated-'),

Consumers should stop using recalled products immediately unless otherwise instructed. It is illegal to resell or attempt to resell a recalled consumer product. Name of Product: Beeswax Rope Candle (SKU # 34-911) Units: About 2,000 Manufacturer: Zhongshan Zhongnam Candle Manufacturer Co., Ltd. of China Hazard: The candle has a clamp (vise) that leads the end of the rope candle at the top. When clamped properly it is supposed to self-extinguish the candle when the burning wick meets the metal clamp (vise). The clamp (vise) does not always sever the wax close to the wick and does not always enable the wick to self-extinguish. This can lead to the flame continuing down into the coiled section of the candle, which can then ignite and cause fire damage. Incidents-Injuries: Three incidents were reported where the candle continued to burn past the point where it is supposed to self-extinguish. There was some property damage in two incidents; however, nobody was hurt. Description: The Rope Candle is a 21-foot coiled beeswax candle that feeds up to a scissors-like vise. The candle is lit above the vise. The candle is 7-inches tall and sits on an antiqued copper-finish holder. Sold at: Gardener\'s Supply retail store in Burlington, Vt., and in the Holiday 2004 Gardener\'s Supply Catalog sold the candles from October 20 through November 12, 2004. Manufactured In: China. Remedy: The firm has designed a scissor like attachment that fits on top of the clamp (vise). This cuts the wax from the sides and extinguishes the flame, preventing the candle from burning below the attachment and igniting the entire candle. The firm will either replace the candle with the new fitting, give store credit for the original cost of the rope candle or give a full refund.

Announce Recall of Novelty Lighters WASHINGTON, D.C. - In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), Prometheus International Inc., of Bell, Calif., is recalling about 4,000 novelty lighters. The lighters do not have any child-resistant mechanisms, as required by the Consumer Product Safety Act. Young children could ignite the lighters, presenting a fire hazard. These lighters were discovered by CPSC by monitoring Internet web sites as part of Operation Safe Online Shopping (SOS). Operation SOS, launched in December 1999, is a CPSC initiative that monitors web sites for recalled, illegal and potentially hazardous consumer products being sold in cyberspace. CPSC and Prometheus International Inc. are not aware of any incidents or injuries involving these lighters. This recall is being conducted to prevent the possibility of injuries. The Intruder model lighter looks like a miniature propane or scuba tank, with a rectangular sleeve on the side into which the bottom part of the black activation-ignition button fits. The top two-thirds of the cylindrical tank body and the sleeve are black, and the tank is clear and transparent. A label on one side of the sleeve reads \"Prometheus.\" A cover hides the flame port. The Jupiter model lighter has a metal body with a black top and bottom. The lighter has a distinctive gun-like shape. It has a hinged cover for the flame port. The cover opens when the ignition switch is pressed or the hinged cover is pulled back, and a high-intensity torch flame is produced. On the end opposite the flame port, a black screw-on cover hides the refill port. The brand name \"Prometheus\" is engraved into the lower area of one side of the lighter body. Tobacco stores nationwide sold these lighters from March 1997 through February 1999 from $50 to $75. The company advertised these lighters on their web site at www.prometheuskkp.com.

(\"Mega Brands\") (the new owner of Rose Art Industries, Inc.) to announce an expanded recall. In excess of 4 million units are involved. The recall includes all sets, except newer Magnetix sets sold since March 31, 2006, that are age-labeled 6+ and sets that contain the following caution label: \"CAUTION: Do not ingest or inhale magnets.Attraction of magnets in the body may cause serious injury and require immediate medical care.\" Mega Brands advises that sets currently at retail better retain magnets due to improved quality control, material and design changes. These products are not included in the recall. To date, CPSC and Mega Brands are aware of one death, one aspiration and 27 intestinal injuries. Emergency surgical intervention was needed in all but one case. At least 1,500 incidents of magnets separating from the building pieces have been reported. Although the hazard was initially thought to be a problem primarily for children younger than six, it has since been learned that at least ten injuries involved children between the ages of 6 and 11 years old. If a child swallows more than one tiny powerful magnet detached from the plastic building pieces or one such magnet and a metallic object, the objects can attract to each other inside the intestines and cause perforations and-or blockage, which can be fatal, if not treated immediately. \"CPSC is deeply concerned about the dangers that small, powerful magnets can pose to children if swallowed,\" said CPSC Acting Chairman Nancy Nord. \"In order for any product recall to be effective in protecting consumers, we must significantly reduce incidents and injuries from occurring after the recall is announced.\" Mega Brands has been cooperative in this expanded recall. These older sets, which were manufactured in China, contain up to 250 plastic building pieces and 1-2-inch diameter steel balls. The building pieces include 1 1-2-inch squares, 1-inch triangles, cylinder rods, flexors, connectors, x-tenders, and curves and come in an assortment of colors such as metallic, primary, translucent, and glow in the dark. Mass merchants and other toy and arts and crafts stores sold the sets nationwide for between $20 and $60, depending on the size of the set. Consumers should stop using the recalled magnetic sets immediately and contact Mega Brands for a comparable replacement toy.

(June 8) - The Consumer Product Safety Commission Friday said it has learned from the Tappan Company of a defect in certain Tappan Company built-in gas ovens manufactured for installation primarily in mobile homes and other newly constructed homes. The Commission said the defect --a possible loose fitting connection-- could result in a hazard to consumers from gas leakage. The ovens in question were manufactured between January 23, 1973, and May 31, 1973, by the F.H. Lawson Company, Springfield, Tennessee, for the Tappan Company. While the majority of the ovens carry the \"Tappan\" name, some were produced for Montgomery Ward and carry the brand-name \"Signature.\" According to Tappan, the problem occurred in some 15,185 ovens, of which 11,974 have been shipped from the place of manufacture. The ovens carry model numbers AZ12-1239; AZ12-1249; AZ12-1441; AKTM-3850; and AKTM-3893. Some 8,172 of the ovens-- model number AZ12-1239-- are used exclusively in mobile homes. The Montgomery Ward ovens--\"Signature\"--carry the \"AKTM\" model number prefix. CPSC Chairman Richard 0. Simpson said the Commission is asking wholesalers, distributors, and retailers who may have the affected ovens in stock or installed in mobile homes or newly constructed homes immediately to contact the Tappan Company. In addition, Simpson said consumers who may have purchased a Tappan or \"Signature\" built-in oven with one of the model numbers in question should contact their local gas company or the nearest Tappan dealer regarding possible gas leakage between the shut-off valve and the pressure regulator. The Commission was told by Tappan that consumers can locate the model number on the oven by opening the top oven door and looking at the metal strip at the top of the oven which carries the model number on it. CPSC investigators have been sent to the Tappan headquarters, Mansfield, Ohio, and to the F.H.

(Feb. 6)--The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission today warned consumers who may have purchased a \"Rainbow Lamp\", also known as a \"Mini Shadowy Stand\" lamp, to immediately discontinue use of the product. The Commission said the lamp-- which retails for approximately $1.98-- contains defects which could result in a fatal electric shock. Some 35,000 lamps have been sold since February, 1973.

The toy chests, manufactured by the Jackson Furniture Corporation, Jackson, Tenn., were sold by 40 retailers, including Sears, Roebuck and Company, who sold the chest through its catalog. Tile action came after the chests were reportedly associated with the death of one child and serious injury to another in separate incidents. The accidents apparently resulted from the children\'s heads being caught between the front of the case and the top of the chest. Some 13,000 of the chests were manufactured by Jackson Furniture, and 95 percent were sold through the Sears catalog during the past four years. The Consumer Product Safety Commission believes most of these are still in the hands of consumers. The CPSC notified Jackson Furniture Corporation and Sears last November 7 that the chest was involved in the accidents. The death occurred September 3, 1973, and the serious injury January 1972. Jackson discontinued production, and Sears took the items off sale November 21. Jackson issued a national announcement on November 26 advising its retailers to take the chest off sale. The Sears chests can be identified by their padded 3-inch top and come in three colors--yellow, orange, and walnut finish-- with a side print design of lambs and daisies. The Sears catalog listed the chest under model numbers 88063, 88064, and 88065. Sears will continue to refund the full price of the chest in accordance with company policy. A redesigned chest with a lighter and flat lid is now being sold in the Sears catalog. This redesigned chest is not involved in the above action. The Jackson Furniture Corporation, who sold similar chests to 39 other retailers, stated that it will refund the full wholesale price to retailers for return of the chests. The chests are identical in construction to the Sears chests except for a pale yellow metal frame with sides and top decorations in a series of white, green, and yellow circles and star patterns.

Warn Of Severe Shock Hazard WASHINGTON, D.C. -- The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission and Woods Wire Products, Inc. today announced that some 40,000 clamp-on lamps with metal reflectors, manufactured during 1970 and 1971 by Woods Wire Products, Inc. may pose an imminent danger of severe electric shock. When the lamp is plugged in, the metal spring protecting the cord from strain at the base of the bulb socket cap may become electrically \"hot,\" thus creating a shock hazard. Most of the lamps were sold in retail stores between April 1970 and December 1971 for approximately $3.00. Some may still be available. Retailers are being notified. The lamp consists of a bulb socket attached to a bowl-shaped metal reflector and to a clamp capable of gripping the edge of a door, table top, or other item of furniture. Such lamps are used for a variety of purposes requiring extra illumination. Consumers can determine whether theirs is one of the potentially defective lamps by DISCONNECTING THE LAMP from the electrical outlet and examining it as follows: The lamp will have a metal spring at the base of the socket, surrounding the power cord and extending into the base of the bulb socket cap. The wire usually has a black vinyl covering, with the trademark \"INDUSTRO R\" and \"300 Volts\" printed in white letters. These two characteristics will identify the lamp, but consumers should be aware that the metal spring is the primary identifier. After DISCONNECTING and identifying the lamp, consumers should separate the socket cap from the assembly and examine the inside of the socket. If there is a cardboard disc between the spring and the socket assembly, the lamp does not present the potential hazard. However, if there is no such insulator disc, the consumer should call the manufacturer Woods Wire Products, Inc. toll free at 800-428-9511 (In Indiana call collect at 317-844-7262) to receive instructions on how to return the potentially defective socket assembly to the manufacturer.

The company imported from Handicraft Centre in Bombay, India, in May 1971, about 210 full length gypsy type, print skirts. About 150 skirts were sold to unidentified persons by December 26, 1972, when sales were stopped because the skirts were determined not in compliance with the flammability standard for wearing apparel (CS 191-53). Customers who may have purchased the garments should contact India Malaysia Imports, Inc., (212-777-2620) which, under the consent agreement, is required to recall the dresses to correct the deficiencies, destroy them or to return them to the supplier in a container marked to identify the goods for export only and \"dangerously flammable wearing apparel -- not to be returned to the United States or its possessions.\" The skirts are further described as \"dye and dye printed\" and layered from the waist to the ankles.

The welders, sold by mail order for from $9.95 to $14.95 each, may pose a substantial hazard in the form of electric shock and skin burns. The recall is a requirement of an order issued pursuant to a consent agreement accepted by the Commission under Section 15 of the Consumer Product Safety Act. Western Manufacturing and Supply Company, also known a Midway Sales, Inc., has discontinued production of the welders and has stopped all sale of the units, known as Midway Electric Arc Welders, that were made without electrical isolation. The CPSC found that the construction of the unit allowed the power supply voltage to reach the electrodes directly in a way that could result in a shock for anyone coming in contact with the electrodes or a piece of metal in contact with the electrodes. In addition, the welder\'s metal housing lacked thermal insulation, posing a threat of severe skin burns. The welder instructions also stated that fuses with a 30 ampere capacity should be substituted for 15 or 20 ampere household fuses in circuit to which the welder was attached. The welder unit was sold with an assortment of electrodes, an eye shield and printed materials. The name Midway appears on the face plate. Model numbers include DD, D, E, F, DS, and K.

(Oct. 15) -- Hamill Manufacturing Company, Washington, Michigan, and the Huffman Manufacturing Company, Dayton, Ohio, in cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, today warned consumers that 25,000 bicycle child carriers may separate from the bicycle if not carefully installed. The carriers were sold nationally under the trade name \"Tote Along\" during the summer of 1976. Persons who have these carriers should carefully inspect both the latching mechanism which locks the detachable child seat to the carrier and the metal clamp which attaches the front of the carrier to the bicycle frame. Before placing a child in the carrier, check to see that the seat and clamp are secure. The warning was issued after the companies reported to CPSC 10 accidents which involved either a separation of the seat from the carrier or of the carrier from the bicycle. Separation of the seat from the carrier appears to have been caused by a failure to push the seat onto the carrier far enough to secure the locking mechanism. Separation of the carrier from the bicycle may have been caused by consumer misalignment of the metal clamp components and-or extreme over-tightening of the bolt passing through the clamp. In the interest of child safety, the companies are recalling the \"Tote Along\" carrier and are offering a refund to consumers who send them the seat clamp.

Due to an error by the manufacturer in Taiwan, the product contains benzene. The Consumer Product Safety Commission believes that eating or inhaling benzene over an extended period of time may cause a type of blood disorder known as dyscrasias. Blobo Plastic Bubb-A-Loons are distributed nationwide by Imperial Toy Corporation. The product is sold in individual metal tubes and in packages of tubes. More than 15 million such tubes have been shipped by Imperial since 1973. Imperial Toy Corporation has voluntarily agreed to cooperate with the Consumer Product Safety Commission and recall all of these products, offering a full refund to purchasers. The Blobo Plastic Bubb-A-Loons are sold in three sizes of individual tubes, each packaged in cellophane with a plastic straw, all of which are being recalled. The recalled tubes are the six-gram size, Item No. 028, having a suggested retail price of 10¢ ; the twenty-gram size, Item No. 339, at 39 ¢; and the thirty-gram size, Item No. 548, at 59¢. Blobo Plastic Bubb-A-Loons are also distributed in packages containing a metal tube and plastic straws mounted on display cards. Imperial is also recalling a three-tube package, Item No. 338, at a suggested retail price of 39¢; and a five-tube package, Item No. 625, at 69¢.

(Oct. 21) -- The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) today warned consumers of a possible serious shock hazard from certain portable, immersible electric water heaters manufactured by the Ambory Corp., of Hazel Park, Mich. One of these heaters was reportedly involved in the recent electrocution of a 17-year-old girl in Little Fork, Minn. Sold to heat water in and around the home, the heaters are constructed of an exposed resistive heating element contained within a perforated metal case which permits water to contact the heating mechanism. This element is powered by electrical current from a standard electrical outlet. Potential for serious shock injuries, possibly resulting in electrocution, exists when water contacts the powered heating element. The four heaters in question are the \"Ambory Special,\" \"Jiffy, Jr. ,\" \"Jiffy, Sr.,\" and \"Ram.\" Distributed nationwide, they are sold primarily in hardware stores and tack shops. CPSC estimates that approximately 50,000 of the immersible water heaters are currently in consumers\' hands. On October 20, the Commission authorized its staff to proceed against the Ambory Corp.9 to remove this alleged hazard from the marketplace. CPSC urges consumers to take extreme caution if they use one of these heaters. All four models are sold with instructions warning users not to touch the water container or the water itself while the heater is \"on.\" Consumers are also directed to turn off the heater and unplug it before testing the water temperature.

The Commission advises anyone having possession of such unguarded machines to place these machines in a locked storage area where unwary persons will not have access to them. The machines, which were sold to schools, recreational organizations and individuals, may be labeled \"Dudley\" or \"Commercial Mechanisms.\" In a lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court, the Commission alleges that the unguarded, rotating metal pitching arm can go off suddenly, without warning, and strike persons standing in the path of the arm. The Commission alleges that this has happened in numerous incidents even though the machines were unplugged or turned off. Everyone should be careful of pitched balls. However, the hazard addressed in this action relates to the unguarded arm. The Commission has received numerous reports of serious injuries -- including paralysis, skull fractures, brain damage, loss of sight, and other severe injuries such as broken bones -- suffered by persons hit by the pitching arm. In one reported incident, a nine-year-old boy was left a permanent paraplegic as a result of being hit in the head by the pitching machine. According to reports received by the Commission: baseball coaches, high school students, \"Little League\" instructors, and even small children who have come up to the machine just to look at it, have been seriously injured. These reported injuries have occurred on school grounds, in city parks, and at private homes. Reportedly, about 7,500 of the baseball pitching machines were manufactured between 1956 and 1975 and distributed nationwide. The majority of the owners appear to be institutions such as schools and \"Little League\" teams, but some machines are privately-owned. The machines were sold under various brand names including: \"Olympia, \" \"Olympic,\" \"Champ,\" \"Blazer,\" \"Super Blazer,\" \"Pro-Blazer,\" \"Range Blazer, \" \"Range, \" \"Master,\" \"Mentor,\" \"Pro-Trainer,\" and \"Professional.\" The pitching machines are operated by electricity or gasoline engine. Even when the machine is turned off or unplugged, however, if the pitching arm is cocked in approximately the \"10 o\'clock position,\" the machine can fire if jarred or subjected to vibration. Consequently, the Commission warns that the machines should be locked up to prevent accidents and should never be left in areas where children can reach them. Before locking up the machine, CPSC advises that the pitching arm cable be disconnected carefully from the coil spring. The Commission has filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia seeking to compel the manufacturer and distributors of the machines to provide a guard for the pitching arm at no cost to the purchaser.

The machines, which were sold to schools, recreational organizations and individuals, may be labeled \"Dudley\" or \"Commercial Mechanisms.\" In a lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court, the Commission alleges that the unguarded, rotating metal pitching arm can go off suddenly, without warning, and strike persons standing in the path of the arm. The Commission alleges that this has happened in numerous incidents even though the machines were unplugged or turned off. Everyone should be careful of pitched balls. However, the hazard addressed in this action relates to the unguarded arm. The Commission has received numerous reports of serious injuries -- including paralysis, skull fractures, brain damage, loss of sight, and other severe injuries such as broken bones -- suffered by persons hit by the pitching arm. In one reported incident, a nine-year-old boy was left a permanent paraplegic as a result of being hit in the head by the pitching machine. According to reports received by the Commission: baseball coaches, high school students, \"Little League\" instructors, and even small children who have come up to the machine just to look at it, have been seriously injured.

Reportedly, about 7,500 of the baseball pitching machines were manufactured between 1956 and 1975 and distributed nationwide. The majority of the owners appear to be institutions such as schools and \"Little League\" teams, but some machines are privately-owned. The machines were sold under various brand names including: \"Olympia, \" \"Olympic,\" \"Champ,\" \"Blazer,\" \"Super Blazer,\" \"Pro-Blazer,\" \"Range Blazer, \" \"Range, \" \"Master,\" \"Mentor,\" \"Pro-Trainer,\" and \"Professional.\" The pitching machines are operated by electricity or gasoline engine. Even when the machine is turned off or unplugged, however, if the pitching arm is cocked in approximately the \"10 o\'clock position,\" the machine can fire if jarred or subjected to vibration. Consequently, the Commission warns that the machines should be locked up to prevent accidents and should never be left in areas where children can reach them. Before locking up the machine, CPSC advises that the pitching arm cable be disconnected carefully from the coil spring. The Commission has filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia seeking to compel the manufacturer and distributors of the machines to provide a guard for the pitching arm at no cost to the purchaser. Without such a guard, the Commission warns, the machines are dangerous and may cause severe injury.

The Commission advises anyone having possession of such unguarded machines to place these machines in a locked storage area where unwary persons will not have access to them. The machines, which were sold to schools, recreational organizations and individuals, may be labeled \"Dudley\" or \"Commercial Mechanisms.\" In a lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court, the Commission alleges that the unguarded, rotating metal pitching arm can go off suddenly, without warning, and strike persons standing in the path of the arm. The Commission alleges that this has happened in numerous incidents even though the machines were unplugged or turned off. Everyone should be careful of pitched balls. However, the hazard addressed in this action relates to the unguarded arm. The Commission has received numerous reports of serious injuries -- including paralysis, skull fractures, brain damage, loss of sight, and other severe injuries such as broken bones -- suffered by persons hit by the pitching arm. In one reported incident, a nine-year-old boy was left a permanent paraplegic as a result of being hit in the head by the pitching machine.

(Apr. 21) -- The staff of the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) today warned consumers that certain portable, immersible electric water heaters manufactured by G.L. Electric Flasheat Co., Harper Woods, Mich., may cause serious electric shock during use. An identically designed electric water heater made by another company was reportedly involved in the electrocution of a teenage girl last year. The heaters are sold, among other things, to heat water in the bathroom and kitchen. They are plugged into a standard electrical outlet and consist of an exposed resistive heating element contained either inside a cylindrical perforated metal case or within two round, flat porcelain shells open around the edge. Both types allow water to flow inside the casings and directly into contact with the heating element, thus presenting a dangerous shock hazard if the heaters are on. Consumers are warned that they may be electrocuted should they touch the water container or the water itself while the heater is on. The heaters in question include the \"Fast Heat,\" model 401. Models 501 and 101 have the perforated metal case and model 401,the two porcelain shells. The heaters are sold nationally, primarily in hardware stores and tack shops. On March 24,1978, the Commission authorized its staff to bring an administrative proceeding against G.L. Electric Flasheat Co.. to remove these products from the marketplace. Anyone aware of shocks or electrocutions from one of these immersible electric water heaters should report the incident by calling CPSC\'s toll-free Hotline at 800-638-2772.', 'G.L.

Only women\'s rechargeable shavers with the model numbers 3B2L or 6B2L imprinted on the base plate on the bottom of the shaver and NOT containing a large R on the base plate are being corrected. No other Remington shavers are involved. Although no incidents of shock have been reported, consumers who have a model 3B2L or 6B2L women\'s rechargeable shaver are urged to discontinue use of the product and to send their names and addresses to Sperry Remington, Dept.

(June 5) -- American Electric Corp., Culver City, Calif., in cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), today announced a voluntary replacement, refitting and refund program involving two styles of its model 7000 \"Great American Frying Machine,\" mini electric deep fryers, because they may pose an electric shock hazard. CPSC is aware of one alleged electric shock incident involving each fryer style out of approximately 260,000 marketed. Both styles retailed for about $14.95, and were sold nationwide. This program does not apply to model 7000A fryers. One of the model 7000 styles has two white plastic carrying handles and stands on three black plastic legs. It is encased in a two-tone metal housing with a black top half and a gold bottom half. This style was marketed between January and April 1977. The company will replace this style free of charge. The second style is similar to the first, except it has a black plastic circular base and a single bucket-type plastic handle. This style was marketed between April and December 1977. The company will refit this style with additional electrical insulation. The company warns consumers to immediately stop using these mini fryers and return them to American Electric Corp., 9937 W. Jefferson Blvd., Culver City, Calif. 90230, Attention: Consumer Relations Department. CPSC believes that these two styles of mini deep fryers may, in some instances, pose a potential shock hazard because of the possibility that internal wiring may move during use and contact the metal casing. Any consumer who wants a refund for either style must send the unit to the American Electric Corp., along with proof of purchase indicating the price. Consumers will be reimbursed for postage costs.

(June 22) -- Collier-Keyworth Co., Gardner, Mass., in cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), today announced a voluntary repair program for about 5,600 of its models 6805, 6806, 7805 and 7806 car seat-stroller conversion kits. The kits are used to convert a baby car seat into a stroller by snapping the seat onto a frame. CPSC staffers believe that a design defect in the metal seat supports of the stroller frame could cause the supports to spread apart, allowing the seat to disengage and throwing the infant forward. CPSC has learned of 13 incidents where this happened. At least five of the children received lacerations and other facial injuries. The stroller kits in question, which were distributed nationwide, retail for about $28 and were manufactured before March 14,1977. Some, but not all, the units may have the model number on the back leg of the frame. More important, if your stroller conversion kit does not have two hinged metal braces riveted at right angles to the top of the stroller frame seat support and reinforcing the seat from directly beneath, call or write Collier-Keyworth Co., P.O. Box 528, Gardner, Mass. 01440 (617-632-0120) to get a free repair kit. After July 1, 1978, retailers selling the conversion kits should be displaying an illustrated recall poster which consumers can check to see if they own one of the affected kits.

The adapters are orange and can be identified by the number \"86-210\" molded on the outside surface. The adapters are supplied as standard equipment with hedge trimmers, along with instructions for attaching the adapter to an extension cord. Consumers should immediately stop using the adapters and closely examine them for any metal showing through the outside surf ace. Adapters showing metal should be returned for free replacement to any Black and Decker Service Center, or a Black and Decker-authorized service center listed in the yellow pages. The company, which informed CPSC of the potential safety hazard on July 11,1978, sent letters providing recall instructions to all consumers who mailed in the registration card packed with the hedge trimmers.

(Oct. 19) -- Carrier Corporation, Syracuse, N.Y., in cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), today announced it is voluntarily recalling two models of room air conditioners produced between 1962 and 1964. The company said engineering tests on several of the 14 to 16-year-old units had revealed the deterioration of a terminal board insulator which could cause an electrical short that might ignite adjacent combustible material. Three fires last May involving these unit models in an apartment complex in Anaheim, Calif., were reported by the company to CPSC. There were no reported injuries related to those fires. The product involved is a 6,000 BTU air conditioner sold under the Carrier \"Weathermaker\" brand name and identified by the mode1 number 51GA0661 or 51GB0661. The model number will be found on a metallic plate behind the unit\'s decorative front grille, which can be snapped out easily. The units generally would be used to cool a single small room, such as a bedroom, and, in most instances, would be installed in a window. The units are about 16 1-2 inches high, 22 inches wide, 11 1-4 inches deep and weigh 100 pounds. They were sold throughout the continental U.S. during the years 1962-65 at a retail price of $185 to $210. Carrier said the company had produced a total of 21,591 such units, that they are now well beyond their normally expected product life, and that age, moisture and heat contributed to the deterioration of the electrical terminal board. The company estimates that as many as 2,782 units or as few as 628, might still be in service. Consumers having units as identified for the recall are urged to disconnect the air conditioner from the electrical outlet and to cease using it immediately. They should telephone their nearest Carrier room air conditioning dealer, as listed in the Yellow Pages Directory. Units will be repaired at no cost to the consumers.

Consumers who have bought one of these toys should not let their children play with it, and should return it to their nearest Eagle Family Discount Store for a full refund.

These caps can be removed by a force of three or four pounds, leaving the ends of the metal rods completely exposed. If the toy gun is cocked and discharged, the exposed ends of the metal rods could then be propelled forward into a child\'s face or eyes. The double-barreled toy cork shotgun retailed for about $1.27 in Eagle Family Discount Stores located in Florida and in a few stores in Alabama and Georgia, according to Eagle. The words, \"Gun Fighter,\" appear in silver on each side of the toy gun. The stock is colored brown, the gun barrels are black and the cocking lever is chrome-colored plastic. The toy gun was made in Hong Kong or Taiwan, according to Eagle, and was identified as product no. 97-S-510,, which appears on the toy gun\'s package. To date, CPSC is aware of one incident of eye injury occurring when a three and one-half year-old boy apparently shot the toy gun into his eyes and was struck by the unprotected metal rod. Although the injury occurred to a three and one-half year old, the product\'s package contains, according to Eagle, a cautionary statement that the toy shotgun is not recommended for children under five years of age.

(March 9) -- Montgomery Ward and Co., in cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), today announced that it is continuing a voluntary repair program to correct a potential shock hazard in certain Wards\' Powr-Kraft model TGB-5102A six-inch bench grinders. This additional notice of the voluntary repair program is being issued in hopes of receiving a better consumer response. The program was first announced by the manufacturer, McGraw-Edison Co., on August 29, 1978. A protective sleeve that insulates an electric lead wire may wear through on some units if in contact with the motor shaft. Severe shock could result if the bench grinder is not properly grounded and the user is grounded or is touching a grounded metal object such as a water pipe. The repair program applies only to Powr-Kraft model TGB-5102A grinders with a \"77F\" date code embossed on the nameplate and to certain units with the same model number that were purchased after June 1973, but show no date code. Units with the \"77F\" date code that bear an orange inspection sticker on either the unit or its packing carton have already been inspected and are not subject to this repair program. The grinder should not be used until it has been inspected and reworked. For instructions on having the units checked and repaired free-of-charge, owners of the grinders should write to: Bench Grinder Repair Program, C-O National Service Manager, Portable Appliance and Tool Group, McGraw-Edison Co., 2nd and Vine Sts., Boonville, MO. 65233.

C. (April 16 ) -- Carrier Corporation, Syracuse, N.Y., in cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) today reissued the announcement of its October 20, 1978 recall of two models of room air conditioners produced between 1962 and 1964. The company said engineering tests on several of the 14 - 16 year old units have revealed deterioration of a terminal board insulator, which could cause an electrical short that might ignite adjacent combustible material. Three fires in May 1978, in an apartment complex in Anaheim, Calif., were reported by the company to CPSC. There were no reported injuries. The product is a 6,000 BTU air conditioner sold under the Carrier \"Weathermaker\" brand name and bearing model number 51GA0661 or 51GB0661. The model number is on a metal plate behind the unit\'s decorative front grille, which can be snapped out easily. The units are used to cool a single small room, such as a bedroom, and are usually installed in a window. The units are about 16-l-2 inches high, 22 inches wide, and 11-l-4 inches deep, and weigh 100 pounds. They were sold throughout the continental United States from 1962-65 at a retail price of $185-$210. Carrier said that it produced 21,591 of the units, but because they are now well beyond their normally expected product life it is estimated that only as many as 2,782 units or as few as 628 might still be in service. Consumers having one of these units are urged not to use it and to disconnect it from the electrical outlet. They should telephone their nearest Carrier room-air conditioning dealer, listed in the Yellow Pages, to arrange for a free repair. Consumers who need additional information should write to Carrier Air Conditioning, Carrier Parkway, Syracuse, N.Y. 13221, or phone the company\'s Consumer Relations Department at (315) 432-7651.

(Aug. 9) -- The F. J. Strauss Company, Inc., an importer and distributor with headquarters in New York City, is voluntarily recalling approximately 3,600 toy cork rifles because they may injure children\'s eyes. The recall is being conducted in cooperation with the Consumer Product Safety Commission. According to CPSC staff, children run the risk of serious eye injuries if they remove the gun\'s muzzle and fire toward their faces, an action which could drive two interior metal rods into their eyes. These \"pushrods,\" which serve to expel the cork from the toy I normally are protected from extending to their full 8-inch length by small plastic barriers. However, some barriers may be positioned improperly, allowing the metal rods to project completely when the trigger is pulled. While F. J. Strauss never has received a complaint about the toy, CPSC received a report earlier this year that a 3+year-old boy suffered eye injuries from an identically constructed toy cork gun made by another manufacturer; all of these models have since been recalled. Strauss has told CPSC that other firms also have distributed identical toy guns. The cork guns have been marketed since 1977 in cardboard boxes which are labeled \"F. J. Strauss Co., Inc., New York, New York, 10010.\" The cartons also are labeled with the trademark \"Straco,\" and with \"Western Double-Barrel Cork Rifle.\" They sold for approximately $1.99 at various retail outlets.

(Sept. 4) -- Corning Glass Works and the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission today announced a voluntary action by the company to remove virtually all Corning Ware coffee percolators from consumer use. Some of these coffeemakers can be dangerous to use because the handle and metal band may separate without warning from the white glass-ceramic pot. Consumers owning Corning Ware percolators are advised to stop using them immediately. If such a separation occurs on a coffeemaker containing hot liquid, the consumer can be burned. As part of its voluntary corrective action, Corning has prepared an incentive program to get consumers to stop using these coffeemakers. The company has purchased advertising space in hundreds of newspapers nationwide telling consumers what to do. The advertisements, scheduled to appear beginning September 10th, will contain coupons through which coffeemaker owners may obtain details from Corning regarding the plan. Consumers also may receive information concerning the program from Corning Glass Works, P.O. BOX 5750, Corning, New York 14830, but are requested to use the coupons which will be appearing in their local newspapers. The Commission has accepted Corning\'s Corrective action Plan. Corning has manufactured and sold approximately 18.5 million Corning Ware percolators since they were introduced in 1960. Due to normal product attrition, a smaller number is believed to be still in use. In 1976 Corning recalled approximately 400,000 electromatic percolators manufactured in 1974. With respect to its other percolators, since 1972 Corning has received approximately 7,000 separation complaints including reports of approximately 1,250 injuries. Corning said these represent approximately 4 complaints and 0.7 injury complaints per 10,000 percolators sold. Corning said that these rates are low, but it has decided voluntarily to remove the percolators from service rather than risk any further injuries or inconvenience on the part of its customers. The cause of the separation problem has been traced to the epoxy sealant which was intended to fasten the handle-metal band assembly to the white glass-ceramic pot. This sealant can dry out and become brittle, causing the two parts to separate without warning. The separation problem does not extend to Corning\'s \"Pyrex\" brand clear glass percolators or to any other Corning coffeemakers, and those products are not included in the program, Corning said. The Commission and Corning request that consumers not return coffeemakers to the company or to retailers. They should be taken out of use immediately and retained until the owner receives instructions on the program from Corning. Corning said consumers should allow at least eight weeks for the company\'s response.', 'Coffee Percolators-Coffeemakers Corrected by Corning', '2014-12-18', 'Corning Ware Pyrex coffee percolators', 'https:--www.cpsc.gov-Recalls-1979-Major-Corrective-Action-Set-On-Corning-Ware-Coffee-Percolators'),

(July 21, 1980) -- A program to repair approximately 55,000 \"Craftsman Motorized Miter Saws\" which may pose a laceration hazard to consumers is being conducted by Sears, Roebuck & Company. Sears is conducting the program voluntarily in cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission. The saws can accommodate several types of blades, including a carbide-tipped blade often used to cut soft metals. Because a carbide-tipped blade is thicker than the original blade provided with the saw, consumers may improperly fasten the carbide blade to the motor shaft, creating the possibility that the saw blade may spin off the saw while in use. CPSC has been informed of three instances in 1980 in which carbide-tipped blades being used on the saws disengaged while still spinning. One incident resulted in severe facial lacerations to the consumer. No injuries were reported in the other two cases. The repair program applies to the model 315.23730 and the 315.23731 \"Craftsman Motorized Miter Saws.\" The model numbers can be found on a plate on the saw motor. The saws have been sold by Sears nationwide from July 1978, through June, 1980, for approximately $200. Consumers immediately should stop using carbide-tipped blades with these saws. To obtain a free repair kit, complete with installation instructions, consumers should contact their local Sears retail store or call toll-free 800-845-4781.

(January 26) -- Following reports of serious injuries involving snowmobile drive tracks, a three to four million dollar voluntary repair program to correct approximately 16,500 1978 and 1979 model snowmobiles was announced today by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission and Kawasaki Motors Corp. (USA) of Santa Ana, California. CPSC staff learned of the problem with the snowmobile tracks in May, 1980, when the company notified CPSC of several incidents involving bar detachment injuries. To date, CPSC staff has been informed by Kawasaki of approximately 20 such injury incidents, including fractures or severe lacerations which in three cases required the amputation of a finger. These incidents occurred when the snowmobile had been lifted or turned on its side and the track was rotating at high speeds. In settlement of its alleged failure to report promptly to CPSC information which the Commission believes indicated that these snowmobile tracks could pose a substantial risk of injury to the public, Kawasaki has agreed to pay $90,000 to CPSC. The snowmobile tracks involved are the MGB (molded grouser bar) type which were designed and manufactured by Kawasaki and by the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co. The tracks have experienced detachment of the metal bar from the rubber belts of the track. Kawasaki has not used this track on any of its models since 1979. When the bars become partially or completely detached from the rubber belts and when the snowmobile is lifted or turned on its side exposing the rotating track, bars can strike the hands, legs or feet of a person who is lifting the snowmobile or standing next to the rotating track. Kawasaki is notifying by mail all snowmobile owners with registered warranties for the 1978 and 1979 Invader and Intruder models, informing them of the safety hazard and the company\'s track replacement program. Notice also will be given through Kawasaki dealers nationwide. Kawasaki has agreed to replace, free-of-charge, all MGB tracks on the 1978-79 Intruder and Invader models with its current model track which has no bars. The company estimates that the replacement program will cost between $3 million and $4 million. Owners of these snowmobile models are being urged to contact their local Kawasaki dealer promptly (but no later than June 30, 1981) for information on the track replacement program. Track replacement will be performed by Kawasaki dealers as the replacement tracks become available from the manufacturer. In connection with the $90,000 payment and the voluntary corrective action plan, Kawasaki denies that there was any failure to report information as required by law, and further denies that any substantial risk of injury exists.', 'Snowmobiles Recalled by Kawasaki', '2014-12-18', 'Intruder snowmobiles', 'https:--www.cpsc.gov-Recalls-1981-Recall-Program-To-Correct-Snowmobiles-Arranged-By-Commission-And-Kawasaki-Motors'),

The recall is being conducted voluntarily in cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission. Radio Shack is a division of the Tandy Corporation. Each kit consists of 11 separate pieces, including two probes which are plugged into lead wire tips and used to test electrical current.

One consumer has reported receiving a shock from the product. The kits were manufactured from 1971 through June, 1980, and were sold nationwide in Radio Shack retail stores for $4.99 each. They can be identified by catalog number 270-332 which appears on the package. Consumers should return their kits to the nearest Radio Shack store for a full refund.

This product converts a regular dry vacuum cleaner to a vacuum cleaner which can pick up water or other liquids from floors and other surfaces. The product consists of a 3 l-2-gallon plastic bucket and two adapter hoses, one of which can be connected to a dry vacuum cleaner. Sun Hill Industries and the CPSC are concerned that an electric shock hazard could result if the product\'s bucket becomes full of water or accidentally tips over. Water could then be sucked into the vacuum cleaner, soaking the motor. This could result in a potentially severe or fatal electric shock if anyone touched a metallic part of the vacuum cleaner while standing on a wet floor. No accidents have been reported by purchasers or users of the attachment since it was first introduced in March of 1980. However, Sun Hill Industries is recalling the product in the interest of consumer safety. Sales were discontinued in February 1981, after almost 1,000 units had been distributed. Consumers who have purchased the Sun Vac are requested to return the product directly to Sun Hill Industries, Inc., Glenbrook Industrial Park, 652 Glenbrook Road, Stamford, CT 06906.

The repair program is being conducted as a result of alleged insufficient support for the cradle\'s masonite bottom board which may allow infants to fall out of the cradle if the board is not positioned properly during assembly by the purchaser. The Commission is aware of 36 instances of the bottom collapsing which resulted in children falling out of the cradle to the ground. In at least 13 of these instances, injuries resulted consisting of bruises and cuts to the infants. The repair program applies to Converta Cradles manufactured from September, 1979 through July, 1980. The product is marketed as a 3 in 1 unit which can be used as a cradle, a swing or a carry cradle. The cradle consists of mesh sides with a steel tubular carrying handle which connects to the wind up mechanism. Those cradles which do not have two metal rods supporting the bottom board are affected by this repair program. The products, which were sold exclusively through Grace Children\'s Products, Inc., for $30 to $45 have been sold in retail stores nationwide under the trade name, \"Swyngomatic\", models 5900, 5905 and 5970. They were also sold by Sears,Roebuck and Co. in its catalogue under the \"Swyngomatic\" name, catalogue i-36261 and 36273; J.C. Penney Company in its catalogue under the trade name \"Toddle time\", catalogue #5161, and Montgomery Ward in its catalogue under the trade name \"Wynd-A-Matic\", catalogue number 5339.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Originally issued December 5, 1983; Revised July 10, 2001 Release # 83-062 Pixieland To Repair Potentially Hazardous Playground Equipment Washington, D.C.-- In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, Pixieland, Incorporated, Swainsboro I Georgia, today announced a voluntary repair program on five different models of its metal playground equipment which may present head entrapment hazards to children. The products involved are the Double Climber Slide, Single Climber Slide, Toddler Climber, Fence Climber and Rainbow Climber. The five models of metal playground equipment, which range in cost from approximately $85 to $450, are intended for use by pre-school children, and are sold to day care centers, child care centers and other similar facilities. The spacing between some of the rungs on these five models pose a potential entrapment hazard because they are wide enough to allow a child\'s body to pass all the way through, but are too narrow for the head to follow. Consequently, a child could be hung, with his head trapped between the rungs and his feet off the ground. This could result in head injuries, neck injuries, or strangulation. All spacings ranging from 4.5 inches to 7.5 inches represent potential entrapment hazards. The Commission has investigated three incidents in which children\'s heads became entrapped between the rungs on these playground structures. One victim received contusions and abrasions to the neck and head, while another victim had to be resuscitated because his breathing and pulse had been stopped. Pixieland has been manufacturing these playground structures since 1978, with distribution to 21 states east of the Rockies. In 1978, the firm began to redesign this equipment to eliminate the potential head entrapment hazard. However, some of these units still have spacing between the rungs which are in the potential entrapment range of 4.5 to 7.5 inches. The Double Climber Slide, Single Climber Slide, and Rainbow Climber all are rainbow-shaped with apex approximately 4\' from the ground. Each is approximately 4\'4\" wide and 15\' to 16\' in length. The Single Climber and Double Climber Slides have one and two sliding boards respectively, while the Rainbow Climber has no slide. The Toddler Climber is 3\' high 3\' wide, and 4\' long, while the Fence Climber is similar in design but measures 4\' high, 4\' wide, and 6\' long. A sticker label with the Pixieland name and address may be found on some of these structures. All day care centers, child care centers, etc., are urged to determine whether they have any of the five models of playground equipment. If they do, the spacings between all rungs should be measured. If any spacing measures from 4.5 inches to 7.5 inches, discontinue use of the equipment immediately. Firm is out of Business.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Originally issued December 5, 1983; Revised July 10, 2001 Release # 83-062 Pixieland To Repair Potentially Hazardous Playground Equipment Washington, D.C.-- In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, Pixieland, Incorporated, Swainsboro I Georgia, today announced a voluntary repair program on five different models of its metal playground equipment which may present head entrapment hazards to children. The products involved are the Double Climber Slide, Single Climber Slide, Toddler Climber, Fence Climber and Rainbow Climber. The five models of metal playground equipment, which range in cost from approximately $85 to $450, are intended for use by pre-school children, and are sold to day care centers, child care centers and other similar facilities. The spacing between some of the rungs on these five models pose a potential entrapment hazard because they are wide enough to allow a child\'s body to pass all the way through, but are too narrow for the head to follow. Consequently, a child could be hung, with his head trapped between the rungs and his feet off the ground. This could result in head injuries, neck injuries, or strangulation. All spacings ranging from 4.5 inches to 7.5 inches represent potential entrapment hazards. The Commission has investigated three incidents in which children\'s heads became entrapped between the rungs on these playground structures. One victim received contusions and abrasions to the neck and head, while another victim had to be resuscitated because his breathing and pulse had been stopped. Pixieland has been manufacturing these playground structures since 1978, with distribution to 21 states east of the Rockies. In 1978, the firm began to redesign this equipment to eliminate the potential head entrapment hazard. However, some of these units still have spacing between the rungs which are in the potential entrapment range of 4.5 to 7.5 inches. The Double Climber Slide, Single Climber Slide, and Rainbow Climber all are rainbow-shaped with apex approximately 4\' from the ground. Each is approximately 4\'4\" wide and 15\' to 16\' in length. The Single Climber and Double Climber Slides have one and two sliding boards respectively, while the Rainbow Climber has no slide. The Toddler Climber is 3\' high 3\' wide, and 4\' long, while the Fence Climber is similar in design but measures 4\' high, 4\' wide, and 6\' long.

Over four hundred thousand transformer units are involved. The transformer is the small black box which plugs in between the computer and the electrical outlet. Consumers are instructed to plug in their adapter between the transformer and the wall outlet. The company reported it had found by laboratory testing that there is a remote possibility that a failure of the transformer could result in certain metal parts of the computer console becoming electrified thus presenting a possible shock hazard. Neither the Consumer Product Safety Commission nor Texas Instruments has received any report of hazardous incident or injury from the hundreds of thousands of Texas Instruments home computers in use. The 99-4A model home computers have been sold in a variety of retail outlets over the past year at suggested retail prices of $450 and $375 with $100 rebate in effect since September 11, 1982. All owners of the 99-4A known to the company through rebate cards or warranty cards will receive the adapters automatically by mail. The company asks owners who are not sure their names and addresses are in its files to call the Texas Instruments toll free numbers (800-858-4565 or 800-527-3550 ) (Texas only: 800-858-1802), and request that the adapter be sent to them. Prior to receipt and installation of the adapter plug or cord, the company advises consumers to unplug and discontinue using computer if any sign of transformer overheating, unusual odor, or computer malfunction occurs. Texas Instruments is also instituting a green \"Safety Check\" label for easy recognition by customers that the transformers in inventory at retail stores have been inspected and modified as necessary. A similar label will be placed on the transformer and its wrapper inside the box. Consumers who desire further information or who have questions regarding the Texas Instruments 99-4A home computer may call CPSC\'s toll free hotline: 800-638-CPSC.

Consumers should stop using recalled products immediately unless otherwise instructed. It is illegal to resell or attempt to resell a recalled consumer product. Name of Product: Davenport Cribs Units: About 500 Importer: Baby Appleseed, of City of Industry, Calif. Hazard: The cribs fail to meet the federal safety standards for cribs. The cribs have a two mattress support system. The secondary mattress support, used for the lowest position, does not meet the full 26 inch minimum height in its lowest position, allowing children inside to crawl over the railing, posing a fall hazard. Note from CPSC Staff: Federal Regulations require that all full-size cribs have a minimum rail height of 26” to help prevent fall hazards. To determine whether or not a crib meets this requirement, the mattress support platform must be placed in the lowest configuration (for the oldest users of the crib). Once in the lowest setting, remove the mattress and measure the distance from the top of the mattress platform (NOT the top of the mattress) to the top of the front rail. If the crib has a drop side or movable front rail, the measurement should be taken when the rail is in the uppermost locked position. Incidents-Injuries: None reported. Description: The recall includes Davenport crib models that begin with the model numbers 273-xxxx-xxxx and have manufacture dates on or before August 2007 printed on a label located on the right side of the lower inner panel of the crib. The recalled cribs have two mattress support systems-a metal one and a wooden one. Newer Davenport cribs with model numbers beginning with 244-xxxx-xxxx that have one mattress support are not included in the recall. Sold at: Specialty juvenile product stores nationwide from December 2006 through September 2007 for between $600 and $800.

On August 27, 2008 CPSC warned parents, caregivers and consumers to immediately stop using convertible “close-sleeper-bedside sleeper” bassinets manufactured by Simplicity Inc., of Reading, Pa., due to a serious safety risk. On August 28, 2008 CPSC is announced that the following retailers have voluntarily agreed to recall the product and provide a refund or store credit to consumers who return the product to the store where purchased: - Wal-Mart Stores Inc., of Bentonville, Ark. - (800) 925-6278 or www.walmart.com - Toys \"R\" Us Inc., of Wayne, N.J. - (800) 869-7787 or www.toysrus.com or www.babiesrus.com - Kmart Corp., of Hoffman Estates, Ill. - (800) 659-7026 or www.kmart.com - Big Lots!, of Columbus, Ohio - (866) 244-5687 or www.biglots.com - Target of Minneapolis, Minnesota sold at www.target.com only - J.C.

This is the second strangulation death CPSC has learned of in the co-sleeper bassinets. On September 29, 2007, a 4-month-old girl from Noel, Mo. became entrapped in the metal bars of the bassinet and died. The Simplicity 3-in-1 and 4-in-1 convertible bassinets contain metal bars that are covered by an adjustable fabric flap which is attached by velcro. The fabric is folded down when the bassinet is converted into a bed-side co-sleeping position. If the velcro is not properly re-secured when the flap is adjusted, an infant can slip through the opening and become entrapped in the metal bars and suffocate. Due to the serious hazard these bassinets pose to babies, CPSC urges all consumers to share this safety warning with day care centers, consignment stores, family and friends to ensure that no child is placed to sleep in a Simplicity convertible bassinet covered by this warning. Recalled models have removable fabric that is fastened by Velcro over the bars (see top picture). Models that have been modified or redesigned so that the fabric is permanently attached and stitched over the lower bar creating a barrier are not included in this recall (see bottom picture).

S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Shakespeare Company, Newberry, South Carolina, is voluntarily recalling two models of their omnidirectional CB base station antennas, Style 176-S and 176-SU. If contact is made by the antennas with an electrical power line while being installed or taken down, the antennas have the potential for severe or fatal shock. The CPSC stated that in tests conducted on the two models, they failed to comply with the new mandatory standard enforced by CPSC. The standard is intended to reduce the electrocution hazard if the antenna should accidentally contact a power line while being removed or installed. The CPSC is not aware of any injuries or deaths involving any of the Shakespeare antennas. The agency estimated, however, that approximately 45-50 individuals were electrocuted each year through 1981 as a result of CB antennas coming into contact with electrical power lines while the antennas are being put up or taken down. Therefore, consumers should not take down any of the recalled Shakespeare antennas which are already installed. The Shakespeare Company distributed 10,637 of the affected antennas nationwide from May through November of 1983. Each of these recalled antennas bears a three letter code located on the bottom of its metal sleeve and on the identification label on the end of the packaging tube as follows: CHF, CHE, CHD, CHC, CHB, CHA, CHL, CHM. The affected antennas have already been removed from dealers and replaced. Retailers who still have those models in stock should return them to the Shakespeare Company immediately for replacement. Consumers owning any of the models affected which have not been installed should contact Shakespeare, toll-free (800-845-7750) to verify if the antenna is subject to the recall. If so, the consumer should return the antenna to the dealer for a full refund. Consumers who have already installed the affected models should leave them alone. These persons can obtain an additional warning label (or hang tag) to be placed in a conspicuous location on the product to warn future users about the potential hazard. The label (or hand tag) can be obtained by calling the Shakespeare Company at its toll free number (800-845-7750) or writing the firm at RFD #3, P.O. Box 733, Newberry, South Carolina 29108. As a normal practice, individuals planning to install or take down a CB antenna should first contact their local power company for advice.

The Commission has learned of approximately 64 explosion incidents involving this control valve-- including 16 deaths and approximately 35 incidents of personal injury to consumers. The complaint is limited to valves used in water heaters fueled by LP gas. Since LP gas is heavier than air, it does not vent easily and, in the case of a leak, tends to settle toward the floor, accumulate there, and may lead to an explosion when touched off by a nearby ignition source. The combination valve serves the dual purpose of regulating the gas supplied to the water heater and the safety function of shutting off the gas supply when the pilot light becomes extinguished. The complaint alleges that the design of the valve knob, which utilizes plastic lugs keyed into the metal slots of the gas cock, is defective. It maintains that V5130 controls which were made between 1958 and 1976, have knobs that can be easily worn and broken such that the knob can become reversed (rotated 180°) with respect to the gas cock. Should this happen, the knob could become stuck in the depressed position and defeat the pilot-flame safety system. Thereafter, if the pilot flame should go out, the water cools, the thermostat calls for heat, and the control valve opens to heat the water. As a result, substantial quantities of unburned gas will be released through the pilot and main burners and create a serious explosion and-or fire hazard. This control was used on various water heaters manufactured by numerous different manufacturers. Some of the controls are identifiable by the Honeywell name on the front faceplate. Others may only have the name of the water heater manufacturer. The consumer may need to consult his LP gas supplier or a qualified plumber to get positive identification of the valve. Persons who become aware of explosion or fire incidents that may be associated with this product should contact the CPSC on its toll-free Hotline 800-638-CPSC. Information regarding this matter may also be obtained by calling the CPSC toll-free Hotline.

This toy is battery operated and constructed of plastic in the shape of a hippopotamus, with straps for attachment to a crib or playpen and includes a handle for carrying. When the buttons are pushed, knobs twisted or moved and-or dials turned, the toy plays various tunes, makes noises or lights UP. A blue decal with white lettering on the front of the toy reads \"Tiger Electronic Toys HIPPO-LOT-O-FUN.\" The toy is approximately 16\" long by 7\" high by 1 l-4\" thick. When the Commission tested this toy according to safety requirements for toys, a sliding knob pulled off. This is in contradiction of the CPSC Small Parts Requirement which prohibits small parts in toys intended for children under three years of age. CPSC has determined that this knob is small enough to present possible choking and ingestion hazards to children under three years of age. The Commission is aware of one incident involving a 15-month-old child who accidentally ingested the sliding knob from this toy. The mother was able to remove the knob from the back of the child\'s mouth and medical attention was not required. No other accidental ingestion incident has been reported. Tiger Electronic Toys, Inc., engaged the services of an independent engineering firm to also conduct safety testing. Although the toy failed the Small Parts Requirements, when tested under actual use conditions in a children\'s nursery, the children tested could not dislodge the sliding knob. Nevertheless, Tiger Electronic Toys, Inc., has elected to cooperate with the Commission to conclude the matter. Tiger distributed approximately 15,000 of these toys nationally from 1980 through 1982. The toys sold for about $20.00. Consumers should remove these toys from use and return them directly to the company. Tiger is prepared to offer in exchange a SELECT-O-FUN Musical Computer Toy, Model No. 7-511.

Murray Ohio and the Commission have been informed of approximately 48 incidents where handlebars have reportedly become loose or separated from the bicycle. There have been 17 reports of injuries to the rider due to falls possibly associated with the problem stems. This announcement is being issued in conjunction with Murray Ohio\'s replacement program undertaken during the past twelve months involving several major retail outlets which reported problems of handlebar separation to Murray Ohio. To date over 12,000 stems have been replaced. The purpose of this announcement is to information consumers who may not already have had their bicycles repaired as to how they may obtain service or replacement parts. Murray Ohio\'s policy is to replace, free of charge all affected block stems, The following BMX bicycle models are involved in the replacement program: 3-5330x21 3-5330x25 3-5330x38 3-5330x47 3-5330x52 3-5330x63 3-5332x25 3-5622X21 3-5337x52 3-5532x6 3-5430x27 3-5430x30 3-5432x47 3-5432x6 3-5432 3-5532 3-5430 3-5537 3-5337 Murray Ohio\'s engineering analysis indicates that the problem handlebar stems may cause some looseness in the handlebars, usually early in the bicycle\'s use, prior to separating from the bicycle. However, there have been a few reports where the stem has separated causing the handlebars to fall off without warning. Murray Ohio redesigned the handlebar stem assemble beginning in May, 1983, to eliminate the problem. The Company has also notified its service centers to replace or repair pillow block stems on all BMX bicycles involved which have been brought in for any service or repair. Consumers who have purchased these bicycles may identify their unit by the model number stamped into the metal on the left or right side of the front of the frame. Dates of production can be verified from the identification decal above the pedal crank. Dates on the decal would be 08-82 through 12-82 and 01 through 05-83. Customers having one of these bicycles, who have not already had them repaired, should contact the nearest Murray Ohio Service Center as listed in the Yellow Pages or in the literature received with the unit.

The affected washers, which pump water under high pressure to clean porches, houses, motor vehicles, outdoor power equipment or farm equipment, were sold nationally under the \"Big Butch\" trade name by various retailers and under the Sears brand name through Sears catalogs. There have been no injuries or deaths involving the Fimco machines; however; the Commission is aware of 10 electrocutions associated with other electric pressure washers. The washer does not present a hazard if operated according to instructions, according to Fimco. However, the metal handle or other exposed metal part could become electrically charged if the machine is not properly grounded and a fault occurs.

Though no incidents of fire or injury have been reported, Dart Drug Stores, Inc. is recalling the fans in the interest of consumer safety. The Commission staff believes that some of the fans may have a defective 2-speed control switch which could result in overheating of the motor and ignition of the plastic parts of the fan, and that some fans could present a fire hazard. The fans were sold to consumers from approximately 68 Dart Drug stores in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area and in approximately 5 Total Plus stores located in the Richmond, Virginia area. The fans were imported from Taiwan in 1983 and sold for $15.99. The fans are no longer being sold in Dart Drug or Total Plus stores. Consumers can determine if they own the recalled oscillating fan by checking for the \"Snow\" brand name or label in the center of the metal grill on the front of the fan, and for a 2-speed control switch at the base of the fan. The control switch moves-vertically (up and down). The original shipping carton is labeled in part as \"2 speed sliding switch...self lubricating motor for Kent Co., Landover, Maryland 20785...\" The plate at the bottom of the fan may be labeled in part as \"Model CYHD-103...Chin Yung Ho Enterprises Co., Ltd., Taichung, Taiwan.\" The fan is listed by Underwriters Laboratories. Consumers identifying their nine inch oscillating fan as a recalled \"Snow\" fan should stop using it and return it to the nearest Dart Drug or Total Plus store. Owners will be given a full refund of their purchase price. If inconvenient due to the distance involved, owners may still get a refund by calling Dart Drug Stores Inc. at 301-341-0729 for instructions on shipping their fan back to the firm.

Hamilton Beach has also agreed to pay the CPSC a civil penalty of $35,000 in settlement of allegations of the Commission staff, which are denied by the Company, that the Company violated the defect reporting requirements of the Consumer Product Safety Act. Chairman Terrence M. Scanlon and Commissioners Stuart M. Statler and Carol G. Dawson voted to accept the civil penalty settlement. Commissioner Saundra Brown Armstrong dissented from this decision. Under certain conditions, when picked up, the 4-cup glass carafe could slip from its metal handle ring and break, presenting a burn or laceration hazard. CPSC and Hamilton Beach are aware of approximately 260 incidents where a carafe of hot liquid separated from its handle resulting in more than 140 injuries of burns or cuts. The 4-cup coffeemaker and carafe were sold together in both the United States and Canada. While 403,000 of these products were originally produced, it is estimated that 165,000 units remain in use, including approximately 160,000 units in the United States and 5,000 units in Canada. The coffeemaker and carafe were sold in the United States under the Hamilton Beach name as Models 784, 785AL and I 779AL; under the J.C.

The coffeemaker and carafe were sold in Canada under the Simpson-Sears name as Models 67001 and 67002 and under the Philips name as Model HD5184 and HD5185. The product sold for approximately $24.00. Carafes subject to recall can be identified by a label on the bottom of the coffeemaker bearing one of the above listed model numbers and a date code stamped into the underside of the coffeemaker. Only date codes stamped 0880 through 0881 are applicable. The first two digits of the code represent the month and the last two the year of production.

In 1977, the Consumer Product Safety Commission issued a ban to address the risk of tip-over of large unstable metal refuse bins that crushed children climbing or hanging on the bins. The federal ban outlaws metal bins with a volume of more than one cubic yard if they tip over during testing. The Commission test, designed to simulate the climbing and hanging activities of children, requires that bins sustain a horizontal force of 70 pounds and a vertical force of 191 pounds. Before the ban was issued, the Consumer Product Safety Commission had investigated 19 incidents of refuse bin tip-over, involving 21 victims, 20 of them children younger than ten years old. At the time, thirteen children had died from being crushed by unstable refuse bins. Since the 1977 ban, the Commission has investigated an additional 41 incidents of refuse bin tip-over, involving 41 victims, 39 of them children younger than age ten. There have been 16 more deaths. As part of the Commission\'s continuing surveillance to find all banned unstable refuse bins, investigators from Commission offices in Atlanta, Georgia and Orlando, Florida discovered bins owned by ABC Disposal, Inc. in Port Richey, Florida that failed the federal safety standard. The Commission and ABC Disposal entered into a written agreement giving the firm fourteen days to repair or remove from public areas seven remaining unstable bins.

The recently reported second death involved a 21-month-old Pennsylvania child reportedly playing under a Brawny bunk bed with his 3-year-old brother in September 1985. The mattress assembly was dislodged and fell on the younger child. The bunk beds were set up as twin beds at the time of the accident, but did not have cross wires to prevent the mattress assembly from falling through the bed frame. In December 1983, a two-year-old Denver boy died under similar circumstances. In February 1985, Sears advertised the availability of a modification kit in newspapers nationwide and through signs in its retail and catalog outlets. Only about 25,000 of about 112,000 Brawny owners have ordered the modification kit. Sears will use national magazine advertisements and warning posters in its outlets to notify customers of the modification kit\'s availability. The free modification kit was developed to help prevent the mattress assembly from falling through the bed frame. It consists of four metal cross wires. Two cross wires are to be securely fastened from one side rail to the other on each bed.Customers who have a Brawny bunk bed which does not have cross wires securely screwed onto the side rails can obtain a free modification kit by calling 800-831-5551 or their nearest Sears retail or catalog outlet. in Illinois only, customers should call 800-323-0366.

In accepting the settlement, the Commission and the six manufacturers also announced a recall program for the enclosures. These enclosures are associated with three deaths, one incident of severe brain damage, and at least eleven incidents involving minor or no injuries. The manufacturers of the enclosures are Memline Corporation (under the name of Nu-Line Industries); WBI, Inc. (formerly . Worldsbest Industries, Inc.); Paris Manufacturing Corporation; North States Industries, Inc.; Mapes Industries, Inc.: and Creative Playthings (Creative Playthings last sold these products in 1974). These firms are participating in an extensive public notice and recall program to warn the public of the potential for head-neck entrapment-strangulation hazards presented by the enclosures, and to remove them from the possession of consumers. The enclosures are constructed of criss-cross wooden slats, riveted together, which expand to form closed circular structures of varying diameters. The Commission estimates that there are approximately 252,000 enclosures presently in the possession of consumers. Children between the ages of ten and twenty-four months can climb upon the enclosures, and may slip, and catch their heads-necks in the vee-shaped openings at the top of the enclosures, or attempt to crawl through and become entrapped in the diamond-shaped openings in the middle of the enclosures. (See drawing attached) The angles of the vee-shaped openings are sufficiently narrow so as to entrap the head- neck of a child, resulting in potential death by strangulation or in other serious injury. Consumers should immediately stop using the enclosures and return them to Nu-Line Industries, which is handling the recall for all the manufacturers. In return, consumers will receive a $10.00 cash refund or a $15.00 coupon which may be used toward the purchase of any product made by the following firms: Nu-Line Industries: Paris Manfacturing Corporation; and Northstates Industries, Inc.

The units were sold with a metal \"cowboy\" or \"clown\" shroud over the center or with no shroud at all. \"Flying Gym\" swings subject to this program are models 309 (cowboy), 306 (clown) and 305 (no shroud) and were sold nationally to local park and recreation departments and to some schools and churches. From its sales records, Miracle Recreation Equipment Company will contact directly, by registered mail, each known purchaser- of a \"Flying Gym\" unit to notify them of the potential hazard and arrange for a field repair intended to prevent the swing assembly from separating from the central shaft. The firm will provide needed parts, without charge, for the repair and an allowance of $50.00 for welding costs. The manufacturer sold some units prior to 1972, the earliest year for which it currently has sales records. Any owner of play- ground purchased prior to 1972 who believes he may have a \"Flying Gym\" should contact Miracle Recreation Equipment Company for assistance in identifying the product and obtaining information about the repair. Until the repair has been completed, the Commission and the manufacturer urge that the swings be removed from all \"Flying Gyms\" to prevent their use.

NEWS from CPSC U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission Office of Information and Public Affairs Washington, DC 20207 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE March 17, 1987 Release # 87-018 General Housewares Corporation Recalls Magnalite Professional Saucepans Due to Possible Burn Hazard WASHINGTON, DC -- In cooperations with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, General Housewares Corp., Stamford, Connecticut, today announced a voluntary recall of one, two and three-quart Magnalite Professional saucepans that have covers that fit too tightly. If too much pressure accumulates due to a tight fit, the cover may explode from the saucepan or the cover may become difficult to remove. General Housewares Corp., has been advised of nine such incidents, six of which reportedly involved burn injuries and two of which reportedly involved property damage. The saucepans that are being voluntarily recalled are any that were produced between September 1984 and July 1985 that have covers that fit too tightly on the saucepan. The saucepans and covers are cast from aluminum ingot. The saucepans are dark grey in color and the word MAGNALITE is impressed on the bottom of the saucepan. The cover and handle have an aluminum metallic shine, which contrasts with the saucepan. The sauce pans sold for a price between $54.00 - $80.00 and were sold in better department stores and gourmet cookware shops. Consumers can test for any overly tight fit by placing the pan on a stable surface, putting the cover on the pan and pushing down firmly. If the saucepan can be lifted by the cover to any degree, the cover is b too tight. The tight fit may not be evident on the first attempt of testing. If not, repeat the test several times but rotate the cover each time to a different point of contact on the saucepan. Another test is to place the cover firmly on the saucepan and gradually turn it 360 degrees in one direction. If the cover rubs closely against the saucepan and locks in place at some point while turning, the cover on the saucepan is too tight. Since July 1985 General Housewares has employed new quality control measures to safeguard against the possibility of a particular cover being too tight for a particular saucepan. General Housewares is accepting returns of saucepans and tight- fitting covers under the l00-year warranty offered on this product. The cover and saucepan can be returned to: Consumer Relations Department, General Housewares Corp., 1536 Beech Street, Terre Haute, Indiana 47804. The saucepan and cover will be replaced without charge. General House- wares will bear shipping costs. Anyone wishing additional information may call General Housewares Corp., at 800-457-2665 or the Consumer Product Safety Commission toll- free hotline number at 800-638-CPSC.

The portable crib involved has an adjustable floorboard that also allows the crib to function as a changing table. Some 14,500 affected cribs have been sold. The Commission and the firm are aware of an incident involving a young infant who received a fractured skull when the floorboard of her portable crib was dislodged causing her to fall and strike her head on the floor. The floorboard was in the upper \"changing table\" position when the infant\'s grandmother attempted to lower the drop side causing the floorboard to dislodge and the infant to fall. The only other reported incident did not result in injury to the infant occupant. The affected portable cribs are Sears model numbers 29-30691 (maple stain) and 293-0692 (varnish finish) distributed between March 1, 1986 and December 14, 1986. The product retails for about $70.00. The floorboard contains only one clip attached to the underside and is marked with the word \"Front\" on the upper surface close to one of the sides (see drawing). Consumers should stop using the portable cribs immediately and call North States Industries collect at 612-522-6505 to receive a free replacement floorboard. To prevent the drop side from being lowered while the crib is in the \"changing table\" position, North States has redesigned the floorboard. The redesigned floorboard can be identified by its six metal clips on the underside and a cautionary label advising against flowering the drop side when the floorboard is in the changing table position. Only consumers owning a floorboard with one clip attached to the underside are affected by this program. Signs advising consumers of the possible hazard and the availability of the redesigned floorboard were posted in Sears stores beginning in May.

Due to improper assembly, the wiring in some of these units may be cut by the end of the handle tube, resulting in an electric shock hazard. This hazard can occur while the units are being operated or when they are simply plugged in but not in use. Four consumers were reportedly shocked in separate incidents in 1986 and 1987, when they grabbed the metal handle tube of their string trimmers. Though none of these incidents were fatal, the Commission staff believes that a defective trimmer would present a severe electric shock or an electrocution hazard. These Black and Decker brand string trimmers have been sold since October, 1985 by a variety of retailers for about $24.00 to $29.00. The affected trimmers can be identified by a label decal located near the top of the handle, which states \"No. 82209 Grass-Weed Trimmer, Type 1 or Type 2\" or \"No. 82210 Grass-Weed Trimmer, Type 1 or Type 2\" and \"Black & Decker (U.S.) Inc., Easton, MD 21601 USA\" Also, the motor housings of the 82209 and 82210 units are labeled 9\" cut and 10\" cut, respectively.

WASHINGTON, DC -- The U.S. Consumer Product Safety commission announces that it has authorized its staff to issue an administrative Complaint against Miracle Recreation Equipment Co., of Grinnell, Iowa, seeking repair, replacement, or refund of the purchase price of approximately 12,000 Flying Animal Swings. The Complaint alleges that Miracle\'s \"Flying Animal Swing\", a two, three, four, or six seat swing, because of the weight, size, and composition of the individual animal swing figures and because of a metal support tube which projects to the rear of each swing, contains a defect which presents a substantial risk of injury to children. The Complaint alleges that there have been seven (7) cases of serious head injuries and one (1) fatality when children were struck by the swing. Until this matter is resolved, the Commission staff urges the public not to use these swings which are found primarily on public playgrounds around the country. The Flying Animal Swings may be either a pony, seal, lion, or a squirrel. The Commission\'s action was necessitated by Miracle\'s unwillingness voluntarily to remedy this problem.

The Corrective action program was developed by the two manufacturers in response to 387 complaints from owners that their furnaces have experienced internal corrosion. Such corrosion could allow dangerous carbon monoxide to pass into the living areas of the home. Among the complaints of internal corrosion, are eight complaints of nausea. Carbon monoxide is an odorless, but toxic gas which, in large amounts, can cause illness or death. Signs of carbon monoxide poisoning are flu-like symptoms -- headache, nausea, stomach upset and drowsiness. Over a period of time, the corrosion may cause the metal in some of the furnace components to deteriorate, and can progress to the point where holes can be created through which carbon monoxide could be released into the home. Subsequent testing has shown affected furnaces to be susceptible to corrosion when exposed to chlorine- or fluorine- containing compounds -- including salt for melting ice, paint stripper, fabric or water softener, bleach and adhesives -- found in some homes. Homeowners should not store or use such products near these furnaces. As part of the corrective action program, Preway and Arkla will inspect the furnaces at no charge. Based on the inspections, they will retrofit furnaces with an upgrade kit at no charge, or if the corrosion is very severe, will replace furnaces on a pro rata basis. Furnaces covered under this plan were manufactured by Arkla and Preway and were sold by the companies listed at the bottom of the page. Arkla and Preway are also continuing an earlier corrective program which includes the replacement of the external vents of furnaces covered by the plan due to corrosion. There have been 2,036 complaints of corrosion and seven allegations of carbon monoxide-related symptoms attributed to corrosion of the external vents of these furnaces.

A lower than expected return rate has caused the Commission to take the unusual step of re-issuing the warning. The recall includes approximately 500,000 Black and Decker Model 82209 (Type 1 and 2) and Model 82210 (Type 1 and 2) Bump- Feed Grass-Weed String Trimmers. Due to improper assembly, the wiring in some of these units may be cut by the end of the handle tube, resulting in an electric shock hazard. This hazard can occur while the units are being operated or when they are simply plugged in but not in use. Four consumers were reportedly shocked in separate incidents in 1986 and 1987, when they grabbed the metal handle tube of their string trimmers. Though none of these incidents was fatal, the Commission staff believes that a defective trimmer would present a severe electric shock or an electrocution hazard. These Black and Decker brand string trimmers have been sold since October, 1985, by a variety of retailers for about $24.00 to $29.00. The affected trimmers can be identified by a label decal located near the top of the handle, which states \"No. 82209 Grass-Weed Trimmer, Type 1 or Type 2\" or \"No. 82210 Grass-Weed Trimmer, Type 1 or Type 2\" and \"Black & Decker (U.S.) Inc., Easton, MD 21601 U.S.A.\" Also, the motor housings of the 82209 and 82210 units are labeled 9\" cut and 10\" cut, respectively.

Owners who cannot take their trimmers to a Black and Decker Service Center will be able to obtain further assistance by calling Black & Decker toll-free on weekdays between 8:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m., Eastern Daylight Time, at 800-533-4395, or they may write to Black 61 Decker (U.S.) Inc., P.O.

The action is being taken because Fisher-Price and the Commission are concerned that the playhouse could unexpectedly come apart and cause serious eye or other injury to children or adults. Fisher-Price has received approximately 100 reports from consumers about parts of the children\'s playhouse suddenly coming apart, and parts being hurled across a room with enough force to break glass, stick in drywall or cause other property damage. Although several consumers have reported being struck in the eye or face, none of the injuries required hospitalization, and most of the incidents did not involve injury. The \"Pop-Up Playhouse\" is made of colorful fabric, supported by red or blue plastic tubes at all four corners. At the top of the playhouse, six yellow fiberglass rods form arches connected by metal sleeves. When assembled, the support structure is held together under tension. If any of the tubes break, or for some other reason the tension is released, the playhouse parts can come apart and be forcefully and rapidly thrown or ejected from the toy. Consumers with the playhouse should immediately remove the toy from children, then fold it according to instructions that came with the product. Consumers should not disassemble the playhouse until they receive the free modification kit and instructions. Consumers should call Fisher-Price toll-free at 1-800-233-4004 for the kit. Following consumer complaints about the toy breaking apart Fisher-Price redesigned the playhouse and revised its assembly instructions. The metal connectors are now permanently attached to the yellow rods, and the plastic tubes are made of stronger material and are held firmly in place. When consumers complete the modification of older \"Pop-Up Playhouses,\" the products will be the same as the redesigned toy now being marketed by Fisher-Price.

Some two million exercisers of the earlier model were sold nationwide from 1984 to August 1987. Approximately 60 incidents have been reported to CPSC and the firm, most of which involved a broken spring or a footbar assemble coming apart. Consumers have experienced bruises, cuts and lacerations to the face and other parts of the body when the handlebar or spring stuck the user. Incidents showed that the spring of the Rowing Action Exerciser, if extended too far to withstand the stress, could snap. Dynamic Classics is offering owners of the older models a free retrofit kit, which is designed to prevent the spring breaking and the footbar separating. The retrofit kit includes a safety cord to prevent over-stretching and over-stressing the spring, metal brackets to prevent over-stressing the spring loop, and a new extended footbar to prevent separation. Rowing Action Exercisers sold after August 1987 do not need retrofitting. They can be identified by metal brackets already attached to the top and bottom of the spring and a safety cord installed inside the spring. Earlier models had no brackets and a longer safety cord. Consumers should immediately discontinue the use of older models of the Rowing Action Exerciser, which do not have metal brackets attached to both ends of the spring.

Nod and Company of Atlanta, GA is voluntarily recalling approximately two million pacifier holders (Model #CP-301) because of small parts which are a choking hazard. The pacifier holder being recalled is a two-inch by one- inch plastic badge embossed with a rainbow design and the name \"Pacifier Pal.\" On the back of the badge is a safety pin. The product was sold with three interchangeable multi- colored ribbons with metal snaps at each end for attaching a pacifier. The metal snaps may come loose from the ribbon and could pose a choking hazard to infants. The pacifier holders were sold nationwide from 1985 until 1989 for about $2.00 each. Neither the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) nor W.B. Nod and Company is aware of any injuries involving this pacifier holder. Redesigned pacifier holders manufactured and sold by the company since February 1990, and not subject to recall, utilize plastic snaps on the ribbon and have a clip on the back of the badge. The model number for these pacifier holders not subject to this recall is CP-311. Consumers having the model CP-301 \"Pacifier Pal\" pacifier holder should remove the holders from infants and return them directly to W.B. Nod and Company for a replacement with the new product. Consumers who have any questions about this recall may call W.B. Nod and Company at 1-800-882-8783 or write to W.B. Nod and Company at 7000 Peachtree Dunwoody Road, Atlanta, GA 30328. These pacifier holders were imported from China and Turkey and were distributed by W.B. Nod and Company. The CPSC became aware of the hazardous pacifier holders from a consumer complaint about the product\'s safety pin opening during use exposing a child to the point of the pin. No injury occurred.

These cubes, distributed nationwide during the past 2 1-2 years, are 16\" X 16\" X 16\" cubed-shaped trunks with hinged lids decorated with various scenes and motifs. Decorator cubes manufactured after June 30, 1990 have removable lids. The decorator cubes may be appropriately used for storage and as a home furnishing. The cubes may present a strangulation hazard if the lid falls on the neck of a young child who is reaching into the trunk for a toy or other item. CPSC believes young children under the age of six years are at the greatest risk of injury. It was reported that a 14-month-old child died when a cube\'s lid allegedly fell on him. In addition, a young child could climb into a cube, become trapped inside and suffocate if the lid shuts. Approximately 2.2 million cubes have been distributed nationally by the three firms between 1987 and June 30, 1990. To prevent the possibility of strangulation or suffocation: Owners should remove the metal pin (used to hold the hinge together) from each of the two hinges, thereby making the lid removable.

The company believes that a fire hazard may occur when a purchased thermal fuse in the coffeemaker fails to function as intended. About nine million drip coffeemakers bearing the GE or Universal brand name were manufactured between 1976 and 1984. GE has received approximately 400 reports of coffeemakers overheating. It has been alleged recently that one fire caused by a fuse failure resulted in two fatalities and serious personal injury to eight other people. GE has received claims that fuse failures also may have been responsible for fires that resulted in one additional death and 15 personal injuries. Approximately 375 of the claims involve property damage ranging in value from $300 to $1.3 million. As an incentive, GE is offering owners $10 for each recalled unit returned. A $10 check will be mailed when a unit is received by GE. GE will give consumers with recalled coffeemakers pre-paid mailing cartons. In the carton will be instructions that will tell consumers how to arrange for convenient pick-up. This new method of recall is aimed at reducing consumer effort and increasing the rate of return. No units made on or after April 28, 1984 are involved in this recall. To determine the date of manufacture, check the date code number stamped on the outside metal blade of the electric plug. If the number is 418 through 600, the coffeemaker is not involved in this recall. Other GE brand and Universal brand drip coffeemakers which are not involved in the recall are: - Space Maker Drip Coffeemakers (catalog numbers that include the designations SDC1, SDC2, and SDC3) - Percolators Owners of a GE brand or Universal brand drip coffeemaker are asked to read both the catalog number on the bottom of the unit and the date code stamped on the outside of the metal blades of the electric plug. If the coffeemaker is a recalled unit, consumers should call toll-free 1-800-443-9000. The recalled coffeemakers are not repairable, and owners should unplug the unit and stop using it immediately. Consumers are being asked to check the automatic drip coffeemakers at their home and place of work. The CPSC is issuing this joint warning as part of its mission to protect the public from unreasonable risks of injury and death associated with consumer products.

A $10 check will be mailed when a unit is received by GE. GE will give consumers with recalled coffeemakers pre-paid mailing cartons. In the carton will be instructions that will tell consumers how to arrange for convenient pick-up. This new method of recall is aimed at reducing consumer effort and increasing the rate of return. No units made on or after April 28, 1984 are involved in this recall. To determine the date of manufacture, check the date code number stamped on the outside metal blade of the electric plug. If the number is 418 through 600, the coffeemaker is not involved in this recall. Other GE brand and Universal brand drip coffeemakers which are not involved in the recall are: - Space Maker Drip Coffeemakers (catalog numbers that include the designations SDC1, SDC2, and SDC3) - Percolators Owners of a GE brand or Universal brand drip coffeemaker are asked to read both the catalog number on the bottom of the unit and the date code stamped on the outside of the metal blades of the electric plug. If the coffeemaker is a recalled unit, consumers should call toll-free 1-800-443-9000. The recalled coffeemakers are not repairable, and owners should unplug the unit and stop using it immediately. Consumers are being asked to check the automatic drip coffeemakers at their home and place of work. The CPSC is issuing this joint warning as part of its mission to protect the public from unreasonable risks of injury and death associated with consumer products. The CPSC is the Federal agency responsible for consumer product safety.

The firm has notified CPSC of 82 such injuries. The injuries occurred when the spring broke and part of the spring struck the user\'s foot, resulting in bruises, lacerations and fractures. The exercisers are a stair-climber type device consisting of two springs, each attached to a black foot pedal and mounted to a metal A-frame. Black or white metal tubular sections and a foam-padded handle are additional parts provided for consumers to assemble the A-frame exercisers. The unassembled products were sold in stores nationwide. The retail price was approximately $45.00. Dynamic Classics is alerting consumers to correct their exercisers with a free retrofit kit being offered by the firm. The kit provides springs with metal brackets on each end to prevent over-stressing and breaking of the end loops of the springs. Exer-Climbers and Promo-Steppers with the metal brackets attached to both ends of the springs do not require the corrective kit. Consumers should immediately discontinue using Exer- Climbers and Promo-Steppers without metal brackets attached to the ends of the springs.

The company reports that the extreme temperatures generated by the metal halide lamps could cause severe distortion or deformation of the light fixture\'s socket to stem attachment hardware. As a result, the lamp housing can separate and fall from the stem attachment. Any person struck by the falling lamp housing could sustain severe head or bodily injuries. Fifteen light fixtures have reportedly fallen from the ceilings of buildings from August 1988 to March 1990. These incidents occurred in New Jersey, Michigan, and Arkansas. These metal halide light fixtures were installed nationwide primarily in commercial office buildings, public and university libraries, and in athletic facilities such as school gymnasiums and indoor swimming pools. The incidents occurred after fixtures were in use from one to five years. Though no injuries have been reported, the company believes that some of 829 unlocated light fixtures may be defective and could eventually fall. A total of 5,514 halide light fixtures were initially recalled in August 1990. As a result, 4,685 fixtures have either been located and corrected or found to be no longer in use. Despite the company\'s repeated efforts to find and correct all installed light fixtures, 829 light fixtures remain unaccounted for. Lam Lighting Systems, Inc. requests any unidentified contractor or distributor who may know the location of light fixtures which have not already been corrected, to contact the company.

The three models being modified include 189-66-01, 189-96-01, and 189-06-01. According to Toro, the metal cabinets of these controllers may not have been electrically grounded when installed. Under certain conditions, the non-insulated metal parts of the cabinet, including the key lock, could become electrically energized and present a severe electric shock or an electrocution hazard. No electric shock incidents have been reported. However, the company warns that incidents could still occur if metal cabinets are not properly grounded. The Vision II Series Irrigation Controller was sold and installed nationwide for home and light commercial use, from September 1989 through December 1990. These irrigation controllers are designed to program a multiple station sprinkler system. The controller is usually installed on the inside wall of a garage, or on a pedestal outside. The Toro Company began its modification program in January 1991. As a result, more than 30 percent of the estimated 7,500 installed irrigation controllers have already been corrected. The Toro Vision II Series metal controller cabinets being reworked can be identified by the painted white cabinet with a red \"Toro\" logo and a key lock on the door. A \"Vision II Series\" paper label can be found inside the door. Owners should note that all \"Vision Series\" irrigation controllers having gray or tan plastic cabinets are not part of this modification program. Toro requests all owners of Vision II Series Irrigation Controllers with metal cabinets who have not been contacted by Toro or their contractor about this modification program to immediately call Toro at 1-800-367-8676. In California call 1-800-255-8676. Correspondence should be sent to: Vision II Series Controller Kit, The Toro Company, Irrigation Division, P.O. Box 489, Riverside, CA 92502. Also, all unidentified contractors who know the location of installed, unmodified (not grounded) Vision II Series Irrigation Controllers should contact Toro. Once contacted, Toro will arrange for the free installation of a modification kit to electrically ground the metal cabinet of each controller, as needed. Toro warns owners of unmodified or ungrounded irrigation controllers not to touch the key lock or the cabinet until the modification has been completed. Owners who have already had their controller corrected need not contact Toro.

In a lengthy decision and Order issued on July 17, 1991, the Commission unanimously upheld the decision of Administrative Law Judge Paul J. Clerman that the PandM \"WORM GETT\'RS\" was defective. The product, which is used to shock worms out of the ground, can expose users and passers-by to a lethal dose of electricity. The worm probe draws full line voltage, 110-120 volts, to its two, six, or 12 bare metal shafts. The Commission found that by touching the exposed shafts, or even by contacting the ground in the vicinity of the probe, consumers could be shocked or electrocuted. Twenty-eight persons, most of them children, have died using \"functionally equivalent\" worm probes. The Commission ordered PandM to refrain from manufacturing the product, offering it for sale, distributing it, or importing it into the United States. The agency directed its staff to work with PandM to notify the public of the hazard and to warn consumers against further use of the worm probe. Because the owners of PandM have declared bankruptcy, and lack the resources to conduct a recall campaign, the Commission did not require the firm to recall the hazardous probes. PandM can elect to appeal the Commission\'s decision to a Federal court.

The first warning notice was issued jointly by CPSC and the firms on March 27, 1991 following the first reported death. These cubes are 16\" X 16\" X 16\" cubed-shaped trunks with hinged lids decorated with various scenes and motifs. The decorator cubes may be used for storage and home furnishing. The cubes present a strangulation hazard if the lid falls on the neck of a young child who is reaching into the trunk for a toy or other item. CPSC believes young children under the age of six years are at the greatest risk of injury. In addition, a young child could climb into a cube, become trapped inside and suffocate if the lid shuts. CPSC and the firms are now aware of a total of three deaths involving young children allegedly associated with these cubes. These incidents occurred from February 1990 to October 1991. Approximately 2.2 million cubes were distributed nationally by retailers, including Kmart and Walmart, between 1987 and June 30, 1990. To prevent the possibility of strangulation or suffocation: Owners should remove the metal pin (used to hold the hinge together) from each of the two hinges, thereby making the lid removable; or Owners of cubes who choose not to remove lids will be supplied with lid spacer clamps that will prevent the lid from slamming shut and a warning label to remind users of the potential hazards. CPSC urges consumers to call 1-800-766-9417 to obtain free, easily installed spacer clamps, a warning label and further information, if necessary, on the removal of the hinge pin', 'Decorator Cube Safety Warning Reissued', '2015-01-30', 'Seward Luggage Decorator Cubes', 'https:--www.cpsc.gov-Recalls-1992-Decorator-Cube-Safety-Warning-Reissued'),

The CPSC urges consumers to destroy all food that has been preserved using a Micro-Dome Food Preserver, and to call 1-800-736-2330 for instructions on how to receive a $50 rebate for returning the food preserver. The Micro-Dome Food Preserver is used in microwave ovens to preserve fruits, vegetables and prepared dishes. The appliance is a plastic container than can process one standard metal lidded canning jar at a time. Generally priced at $50, approximately 18,600 units were sold to customers. Micro-Dome informed the Commission that the top of the plastic container may blow off in the microwave if the vent stem or safety release becomes plugged. The pressurized plastic container may also explode during or after removal from the microwave, or if the container is hit or dropped. Furthermore, the plastic container may also crack and-or develop lines (called crazing) that could increase the risk of explosion. Explosion of a pressurized Micro-Dome containing hot water and food could cause severe injuries such as blindness and burns from flying fragments and liquids. Micro-Dome reported 29 incidents involving the cracking and-or crazing of the plastic container, eight incidents of the top blowing off, and four incidents of the vent being plugged without the blow plug releasing. One injury was reported involving a user who sustained minor burns when the top of the container blew off. The CPSC recommends that consumers not use the Micro-Dome Food Preserver. It should be returned to Micro- Dome for the rebate or destroyed and disposed of in such a manner that it cannot be used in the future. CPSC is also concerned about possible food poisoning in certain foods prepared using the Micro-Dome Microwave Food Preserver. While CPSC is unaware of any incidents of food poisoning, it is concerned that the product and its accompanying recipe and instruction booklet do not adequately ensure the safety of certain canned foods. In addition to possibly failing to kill bacteria while the food in the Micro-Dome is cooked in a microwave oven, food also can be contaminated after cooking. Eating improperly preserved food can cause serious illness such as botulism. The toxin which causes botulism is the most potent natural poison in the world. Even one taste could be fatal. The Food Safety and Inspection Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has warned that the Micro-Dome needs more extensive testing. There are some problems. According to University of California researchers the Micro-Dome canning process was not successful. Bacteria survived. Micro- Dome denies there is a food poisoning problem. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission is announcing this warning as part of its mission to protect the public from unreasonable risks of injury and death associated with consumer products.

The Maxi Rower consists of two springs, each attached at one end to a common metal frame, and at the other end to separate handles. The user sits on a rolling seat with feet placed in a footrest that is attached to the frame. Overextending the spring on either product may cause it to break and to separate from the footrest bar or from the handle- bar. Upon separation, the spring and handle can strike the user causing eye injury, broken teeth, bruises, and lacerations to the face, head, groin and other parts of the body. Injuries have also occurred from sharp edges on the footrest bar of the Pull-Up Exerciser when the end plugs of the footrest bar come loose. Injuries, including broken bones, have occurred when the frame of the Maxi Rower tipped or broke causing the user to fall. The Commission learned of the problems with the stomach exercisers from a complaint to the Commission\'s Consumer Hotline. Hanover House Industries reported 26 incidents associated with the Pull-Up Exerciser (1.5 million sold nationwide, 1981-1988), and 12 incidents with the Maxi Rower (701,365 sold nationwide, 1984-1989). Hanover House Industries is a catalog-mail order company. The program for these products applies only to those purchased by mail-order. Pull-Up Exercisers purchased from Hanover House Industries after 1988, and Maxi-Rowers purchased from Hanover House Industries after 1989, are not included in the program. Hanover House Industries is offering owners of the exercisers covered by the program a free retrofit kit for the Pull-Up Exerciser. It includes a restraining cord that is designed to prevent spring breakage and separation of the handle- bar from the spring. The kit also includes step-by-step assembly instructions that offer directions on how to secure the end plugs to the footrest. Hanover House Industries is offering owners of the Maxi Rower covered by the program who return a spring from the Maxi Rower, a credit for its original purchase price toward the purchase of another of its products. Consumers may obtain (1) the retrofit kit for the Pull-Up Exerciser; or (2) a credit on the Maxi Rower for a future catalog purchase by calling toll-free 1-800-338-2670. Consumers should immediately discontinue using the Pull-Up Exerciser until the retrofit kit is installed. Consumers who do not elect to repair the Pull-Up Exerciser should discard those units so that no one else may use them. Consumers who have the Maxi Rower should save the spring for return to the Hanover House Industries for the merchandise credit, and discard the remainder of those units.
